article 14
duty of the court as to jurisdiction
the court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it .
n.b. this article seems to be unnecessary in view of a similar text in paragraph 1 of article 17 ( challenges to the jurisdiction of the court or the admissibility of a case ) and could therefore be deleted .
article 15
issues of admissibilitythe present text of article 15 is without prejudice to the question whether complementarity-related admissibility requirements of this article may be waived by the state or states concerned .
the following draft text represents the results of informal consultations on article 15 and is intended to facilitate the work towards the elaboration of the statute of the court .
the content of the text represents a possible way to address the issue of complementarity and is without prejudice to the views of any delegation .
the text does not represent agreement on the eventual content or approach to be included in this article .
1 . having regard to paragraph 3 of the preamble , suggestions were made that the principle of complementarity should be further clarified either in this article or elsewhere in the statute .
( a ) the case is being investigated or prosecuted by a state which has jurisdiction over it , unless the state is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution ;
( b ) the case has been investigated by a state which has jurisdiction over it and the state has decided not to prosecute the person concerned , unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of the state genuinely to prosecute ;
( c ) the person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint , if the security council can refer situations to the court or the prosecutor can initiate investigations , then the appropriate wording may be considered .
( d ) the case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the court.some delegations believed that this subparagraph should be included elsewhere in the statute or deleted .
2 . in order to determine unwillingness in a particular case , the court shall consider whether one or more of the following exist , as applicable :
( a ) the proceedingsthe term &quot; proceedings &quot; covers both investigations and prosecutions. were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the court as set out in article 5 ;
( b ) there has been an undue delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice ;
( c ) the proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially and they were or are being conducted in a manner which , in the circumstances , is inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice .
3 . in order to determine inability in a particular case , the court shall consider whether , due to a total or partial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system , the state is unable to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings .
an alternative approach , which needs further discussion , is that the court shall not have the power to intervene when a national decision has been taken in a particular case .
that approach could be reflected as follows :
&#91; article 16
preliminary rulings regarding admissibility
1 . when a matter has been referred to the court pursuant to article 6 and the prosecutor has determined that there would be a sufficient basis to commence an investigation of the matter , the prosecutor shall make such referral known by public announcement and by notification to all states parties .
2 . within &#91; &#93; days of the public announcement of such referral , a state may inform the court that it is investigating its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts that allegedly were committed in the context of the matter referred to the court and that may constitute offences described in article 5 .
at the request of that state , the prosecutor shall defer to the state &apos;s investigation of such persons unless the prosecutor determines that there has been a total or partial collapse or unavailability of the state &apos;s national judicial system , or the state is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation and prosecutions .
before the prosecutor may commence investigation of such persons , the prosecutor must obtain a preliminary ruling from a pre-trial chamber confirming the prosecutor &apos;s determination .
the prosecutor &apos;s deferral to the state &apos;s investigation shall be open for review by the prosecutor &#91; six months &#93; &#91; one year &#93; after the date of deferral .
3 . a preliminary ruling of the pre-trial chamber confirming the prosecutor &apos;s determination may be appealed to the appeals chamber by the state concerned .
if the preliminary ruling is appealed by the state , &#91; two thirds &#93; &#91; all &#93; of the judges of the appeals chamber must confirm that ruling before the prosecutor may commence the investigation and seek indictments .
4 . when the prosecutor has deferred an investigation pursuant to section 2 , the prosecutor may request that the state concerned report periodically on the progress of its investigations and any subsequent prosecutions .
states parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay .
5 . that a state has challenged a preliminary ruling under the present article shall not prejudice its right to challenge admissibility of a case under article 17article 17 , paragraph 5 , should be revised to require a vote by two thirds of the judges of the appeals chamber to decide that a case is admissible . &#91; or to withhold its consent to the exercise of jurisdiction under article 7 &#93; . &#93;
article 17
challenges to the jurisdiction of the court or the admissibility of a case
1 . at all stages of the proceedings , the court ( a ) shall satisfy itself as to its jurisdiction over a case and ( b ) may , on its own motion , determine the admissibility of the case pursuant to article 15.in the light of the wording to be adopted for article 17 , several draft provisions of the statute may have to be re-examined including article 54 , paragraph 6 , and article 58 , paragraph 2 ( b ) .
2 . challenges to the admissibility of the case , pursuant to article 15 , or challenges to the jurisdiction of the court may be made by :
( a ) an accused &#91; or a suspect &#93; ; the term &quot; suspect &quot; includes a person who is the subject to an investigation .
( b ) &#91; a state &#93; &#91; &#91; an interested &#93; state party &#93; which has jurisdiction over the crime on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the case or has investigated or prosecutedthe final wording of this subparagraph will depend on the content of article 15 .
&#91; a state &#91; state party &#93; of nationality of a person referred to in paragraph 2 ( a ) &#91; on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the case or has investigated or prosecuted &#93; &#93;
&#91; and a state &#91; state party &#93; which has received a request for cooperation &#93; ;
the prosecutor may seek a ruling from the court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility .
&#91; those non-states parties which have jurisdiction over the crimes &#93; this provision would apply to the option where only states parties can challenge the jurisdiction of the court or the admissibility of a case. as well as victims , may also submit observations to the court .
the admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the court may be challenged only once by any person or state referred to in paragraph 2 .
the challenge must take place prior to or at the commencement of the trial .
in exceptional circumstances , the court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial .
challenges to the admissibility of a case , at the commencement of a trial , or subsequently with the leave of the court as provided in the preceding subparagraph , may only be based on article 15 , paragraph 1 ( c ) .the final wording of this subparagraph will depend on the content of article 15 .
4 . a state referred to in paragraph 2 ( b ) of the present article shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.the question arises as to what consequences , if any , should flow from the failure of a state to make a timely challenge .
5 . prior to the confirmation of the indictment , challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the jurisdiction of the court , shall be referred to the pre-trial chamber .
after confirmation of the indictment , they shall be referred to the trial chamber .
decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be appealed to the appeals chamber.the question concerning the suspension of the trial proceeding in case of appeal should be addressed in the rules of procedure and evidence .
article 18
ne bis in idem
no person shall be tried before the court with respect to conduct which formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the court .
referred to in article 5 for which that person has already been convicted or acquitted by the court . 3.further consideration might be necessary in the light of the final text of article 15 .
no person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 5 shall be tried by the court unless the proceedings in the other court :
( a ) were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the court ; or
( b ) otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially and were conducted in a manner which , in the circumstances , was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice .
article 20
applicable law
1 . the court shall apply :
( a ) in the first place , this statute and its rules of procedure and evidence ;
( b ) if necessary , applicable treaties and the principles and rules of general international law &#91; , including the established principles of the law of armed conflict &#93; ;
failing that , general principles of law derived by the court from national laws of legal systems of the world &#91; , where those national laws are not inconsistent with this statute and with international law and internationally recognized norms and standards &#93; .
failing that , and only insofar as it is consistent with the objectives and purpose of this statute :
( i ) the national law of the state where the crime was committed or , if the crime was committed in the territories of more than one state , the national law of the state where the substantial part of the crime was committed ;
( ii ) if the laws of the state or states mentioned in subparagraph ( i ) do not exist , the national law of the state of nationality of the accused or , if the accused does not have a nationality , the national law of the state of his or her permanent residence ; or

6 . the pre-trial chamber shall determine whether , considering the presentations by both the prosecutor and the accused , there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged.a decision needs to be made whether any hearing on admissibility will be held separately , or whether admissibility issues raised by the accused should also be considered at this hearing .
based on its determinations , the pre-trial chamber may : the question remains whether the decisions of the pre-trial chamber on confirmation of the charges should be unanimous or by majority vote .
( a ) confirm those proposed charges as to which it has determined there is sufficient evidence , and commit the person to a trial chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed ;
( b ) refuse to confirm those proposed charges as to which it has determined there is insufficient evidence ;
( c ) adjourn the hearing and request the prosecutor to consider -

3 . &#91; ( a ) the presidency of the court shall make inquiries with the state party that appears likely to receive the court .
4 . &#91; with the express agreement of the state party receiving the court &#93; , the privileges , immunities and facilities provided for in shall continue to be effective when the court holds a session pursuant to paragraph 2 .

&#91; ( e ) ( death penalty ) &#93;
no provision on death penalty .
