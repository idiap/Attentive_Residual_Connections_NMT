a Republican Strategy to block Obama &apos;s re @-@ election
the Republican leaders justified their policy because of the need to combat electoral fraud .
however , the Brenner centre considers this to be a myth and says that the electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people dying from the fall of a ray .
indeed , Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate .
to this end , these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system .
contrary to what is happening in Canada , American states are responsible for organising federal elections in the United States .
and in that same line , a majority of American governments enacted new laws from 2009 , making the process of registration or vote more difficult .
this phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections , which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states .
as a result , in 2011 , 180 law @-@ making projects were introduced which restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states .
the new electoral laws require the electorate to present an identity document with a photograph , as well as an American citizenship test .
on the other hand , these laws reduce the periods of vote in advance , cancel out the right to register as a constituent on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal records .
before the 2006 election , no American state required the voters to present an identity document with a photograph .
the Indian state was the first to demand it .
the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Estonian law .
that is why the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states .
in recent years , these authorities have supported draft law in 34 states to force the electorate to submit an identity document with a photograph .
it is important to bear in mind that , contrary to what is happening in Qéec , American citizens do not have a universal identity document , such as the Social Security card .
indeed , 11 % of American citizens , in other words 21 million of the people of voting age , do not have any identity document with photograph issued by a government agency of their state .
on the other hand , five million new voters in 2012 lack such an identity document .
but , often , obtaining the required identity document costs more than $ 100 .
this means that the new restrictions affect young people , minorities and low @-@ income people disproportionately .
indeed , 25 % of African @-@ Americans , 15 % of people earning less than $ 35 000 a year , 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters aged between 18 and 29 do not have an identity document with a photograph .
there is more .
in many states , the students , the voters who vote most to the Democratic candidates , cannot use the identity document with a photograph issued by their institution .
on the other hand , those same states authorise members of fish clubs or hunting clubs which often vote for the Republican parties to use the documents issued by these clubs .
before 2004 , no state required the proof of citizenship to vote .
the first state of affairs was to present such a demand .
since 2011 , a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens .
these measures are clearly seeking to limit the Spanish vote .
it appears that two out of every three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party .
on the other hand , Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of eight states &quot; scrutiny .
in addition , they restricted the right of the people and the groups to set up a aid service to voters who would like to register .
these restrictions have consequences .
for example , in the general election in 2004 , voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens .
the measures taken since 2009 have made the entry rate of new voters down in 2010 in comparison with 2006 .
moreover , Republican legislators adopted laws in another five states that favored reducing the voting period in advance .
for example , in the 2008 elections in Florida , 33 % of voters who voted in advance were African @-@ Americans , while the latter accounted for more than 13 % of the state &apos;s voters .
in the case of the Spanish , exactly the same thing was happening .
these are only 11 % of the electorate , which amounts to 24 % of the citizens who vote in advance .
however , the targets , which represent 76 % of the electorate , represent no more than 46 % of the citizens who vote in advance .
of course , Democratic legislators and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws restricting the register of voters .
in this sense , the Democratic governors have blocked a number of draft laws .
the US Public Prosecutor intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
it was partly possible to limit the damage .
for example , only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the submission of an identity document with photograph .
however , it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012 .
democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on , as it is clear that they aim to influence the 2012 results in key states .
a report from the Centre for 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed at the polling station to achieve the presidency .
it is too early to state with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election in 2012 .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate .
in this respect , the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system .
screening of prostate cancer : do you get the test or do you not get it ?
indeed , the test of PSA sometimes presents a wrong outcome , with false negative results or even false positive results , after which it is decided to make useless medical interventions .
this is more than enough reason to doubt the already reluctant men about whether the screening tests should be made or not .
whether or not ?
we have requested advice from two specialists .
in the studies carried out in the United States , there was a large rate of infection between the groups of evidence , so it is difficult to interpret these data and make strong recommendations .
for its part , the European study showed a certain difference of death among patients who had been tested and those who did not .
the study , followed at 12 years , also showed that there is between 30 and 40 % of the chances of dying out if the detection test has not been carried out .
I therefore recommend the test as of 50 years , or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer .
men of African @-@ American origin have a higher risk index .
the key is to take a good decision once cancer was detected .
there are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are lazy .
it is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer ; they must be given all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not go against life in the long term , in which case an active monitoring of the disease must be chosen .
today , many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated , as cancer is neither aggressive nor poses a risk to their lives .
instead , we suggest active surveillance of the disease and , if it progresses , we offer them treatment .
we increasingly often have precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated .
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case .
but it is important for you to speak to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be carried out .
it has created , in cooperation with the International Society of Urology , a tool which allows us to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test .
this document can be discharged ( for the time being only in English , but translations will soon be offered in the following direction : at noon : / / b ) .
preventing Disease
unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer .
despite progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of disease .
we believe that if everyone was right and that it was enough , 30 % of cancer could be prevented .
&quot; if no one died , that rate would be increased , at least to the 50 % , &quot; it emphasizes André Silk Society spokesman on Cancer against Cancer .
by contrast , we assess that around 10 % of cancers are hereditary .
many others remain totally inexplicable .
for the Northern Society against Cancer , the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers .
tobacco is linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
it is also a risk factor for other types of cancers .
it damages people &apos;s health enormously .
&quot; today , today , there are still 1.5 million smokers in Qéec , &quot; declared the spokesman André Golidia .
one hopeful fact : 10 years after smoking , the risk of dying of cancer is halved .
the Right
the outbreak and obesity also favor the outbreak of the disease , according to the SCAF .
they will increase the risks of breast cancer , the spinin and of the rupto , of esacely , of pagagas and of the uuine .
&quot; research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer , &quot; they add .
eating
the body also recommends limiting the use of red meat .
in large quantities , they make the risks of cervical cancer rise .
free @-@ collar products must also be avoided .
the preservation of the meat for its smoked , dry or safe meat may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances .
&quot; you can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer , &quot; they explain to us .
vitamins
in recent years , several scientists have studied the links between vitamin and cancer complex .
however , the investigation is not conclusive at the moment .
the SCAF , the studies on vitamin E , are contradictory .
while in one of them a decline in prostate cancer risks was noted , in another , what was noted was , rather , an increase .
the effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been made clear .
on the other hand , Mr Seguro insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and the family background of each with his doctor .
&quot; making the test of detection does not cause cancer . &quot;
the Balion of Stoline in detail
the announcement of the likely discovery of the Great bed River generated a great shock last summer , and rightly so .
it is indeed the case that this Bosnian is a partner of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe , nothing more and nothing less .
what is more , it is the particle , the existence of which predicted the standard model : our best or &quot; less bad &quot; explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter , which has not yet been observed empirical .
but it is not entirely clear to the physics that it is a matter of funeral .
we know without doubt that there is a new particle , and that there is a great deal of the funeral forest predicted by the standard model .
moreover , new data revealed this week at an important physical congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is , although there is still more data to be completely safe .
in any case , we assume that it is a question of Hargs , because the possibilities for getting it wrong seems few : we will see what it is all about .
there is a general and unavoidable law in this great world which means that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time .
there is no way to violate that rule and do not try too much , because it will end up being damaged .
even though the physics of particulates is a very complex world , it has also been shown that there is also a law of this nature : the principle of exclusion of Pli , which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot; quantum state &quot; - a &quot; state &quot; that is &quot; a &quot; that is &quot; a &quot; that is , fundamentally , certain of its characteristics .
physicists classify particulates in two categories .
on the one hand , we are faced with the good citizens known to us , who are wisely adhering to the principle of Pli .
on the other hand , there are the Bosnian Bosnians , a dirty svos of Angists who has no respect for anything , or at least not on this principle , which means that they can be in the same place and at the same time .
according to the website The &apos; New Employment &apos; Programme page , which is , by the way , extraordinary , forests are divided into two groups : the Highlands , which we will not be talking about here , and &apos; particles of force &apos; , for which the great forces of nature are spreading and with which the funeral forest would be in some way in a way that would be in line with them .
these forests , it should be stressed here , are not the exotic twins that we could believe .
indeed , if you manage to read this chronic , it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal forest : the orchestra or the &quot; messenger of light &quot; that acts as a &quot; messenger &quot; of the electromagnetic force .
indeed , when a source of power is accelerating or changing , it is &quot; free of &quot; the electromagnetic field in that precise environment ; a bit like when we set a stone to a pond .
this &quot; disorder &quot; is born into a electromagnetic wave ( from the light , of the underground , of ultra @-@ oil , etc . ) , and this wave is nothing more than a photo , that is to say , one of the &quot; operators of force . &quot;
most stable
the same is true of the anchovy River , with the difference that it is a other area , the camp of anchovy , which needs to be &quot; disorderly &quot; to make it appear .
however , there is a great deal more stability than the electromagnetic field , and it is essential to reach an extremely high level of energy , a bit such as if only a big rock could fall on the surface .
that is why we need an immense accelerator of particles such as that of CERN ( the great crash party is a ring of 27 km ! ) to reach such levels of energy .
the analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between anchovy and mass .
in fact , not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field .
some , such as magnets , do so , but others are not : a piece of paper , for example , never will ever stand at the door of a lake .
and in the same way , not all the particles interact with the camp of Hargs : those that do have a mass , while the rest ( how the orchestra , by the way , does not .
however , what &apos; can you bring &apos; all these investigations , and I am asking Mrs Pleštinská .
for science , this serves to verify the validity of the standard ( MS ) model , and also allows for the checks to be made to the differences between the IPCC &apos;s observations and predictions .
for their part , many people fervently hope they will be , because the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot; new physics &quot; to cover certain holes in the model .
this , it has to be said , is still very lacking , as it does not propose any explanation of the gravity of the matter , or the dark subject , which is around 80 % of the issue of the university ( other devices ! ) .
but we have not found such differences in SAN so far .
impact
the impact of such research on our day is difficult to predict , but we do not believe we are wrong to say that it will not have any .
to see them : in the early 1960 &quot; s , the pioneers of laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would lead to .
they watched the scientific applications , but nothing else .
indeed , as the physicist Wilard Boem , who worked in the Bell laboratories , where the seller was invented in 1960 , and which produced the first device ( the first to be seized ) in 1962 , at the beginning the vector was rather regarded as a &quot; laboratory apparatus . &quot;
imagine ...
in addition , the applications can also come from the whole training that surrounds research .
on the other hand , the same Wilard Boem produced a ray of light in 1969 in the course of his optical research .
despite the fact that it was not at all its original intention , this grab is now an &quot; eye &quot; for all the digital appliances in the world , which won the Nobel laureate in 2009 .
that does not mean , of course , that the LHC activities will necessarily want to transform our lives , but never know ...
follow @-@ up , the best way to die ... 164; Le Devon
in his Commission Morr in dignity , Qéec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life .
the debate must be taken quickly as long as a draft law is being drawn up .
well , within this essential domain , there is still much to be done .
he has tried to look at it closely .
just a few weeks ago , Mr L.lived only on his headquarters from the Mondeterred .
the prostate cancer that he was destroying had given him a two @-@ year breathing space .
&quot; I had been given five years of life , but I have already had seven &quot; who spoke , in fact he went on his bed in the centre of palliative care Victor @-@ Gesis from Beloq , to which the day before was .
&quot; but it is always a shock , we cannot be prepared for it , &quot; it continues .
the disease has caused havoc : a huge weakness that prevents it from going to bathing and even eating on its own .
coming to an appetites lunch , he accepts resigned that he will help him to eat .
at the same time , you even go on to smile , to speak with the unknown people who are devoting them to you , to medicines , and you offer you a bathing .
the courage of ordinary death .
&quot; my greatest desire is that I find me cured in diarrhea , it is humiliating , &quot; trust it .
a few hours later , the team found that wrong .
&quot; in the course of our lives , we learn that a man is a man on the foot , &quot; speak Pierre Brodeur , a psychologist in the winner Victor @-@ Gbois .
returning to their childhood , for certain people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
&quot; that depends on the ability of the person to accept this regression , &quot; he notes .
because , according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care , the great moments take place at the very heart of this regression .
all patients who enter the care centre Victor @-@ Gsois are suffering from cancer .
they have a maximum life forecast of three months .
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer any &apos; cure &apos; care .
the greatest fear for Mrs A. , 89 years , is to die of &quot; conscious and drowning . &quot;
but the disease has made him discover his children .
&quot; I have good children , &quot; he adds .
&quot; I have no more wishes in this life &apos; , he says , before accepting that he should be given a charity to help him breathe .
and he expects , in the coming days , a last visit to his son in Italy .
in Victor @-@ Gbois offers , with a group of volunteers , body care and food aid .
they are palliative care that they are given when nothing else can be done .
to help make his death more comfortable .
in Qéti we have a palliative care bed for every 11.700 people .
it is very little , because we know that everyone will end up dying one day .
here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains the Draa of the center @-@ of @-@ centre teachers , Mrs Schwarzenberg Marel .
whether it be at the level of physical , emotional or spiritual comfort .
it is dying to be put on the back burner or Pessi , according to demand .
diabetes is no longer controlled by its sugar rate .
death is part of everyday life .
yesterday evening we served a beer to Mr X , who died in the course of the night .
this morning , his son ended the beer on the feet of the late .
&quot; we help both patients and their loved ones , &quot; on the basis of Nocalie Savard , the director of the care .
at the Victor @-@ Gboes centre , the day passes without ever being equal .
in the face of a 70 @-@ year @-@ old man who knows his last family meeting in the yard , well placed among his algoers while everyone is drinking on his health , a 36 @-@ year @-@ old girl dies in a tragic way , surrounded by his parents , his wife , and his two children , having tried everything to survive .
&quot; for six months , there are always three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of cancer , &quot; is worried about the Draa .
there are 53 % of the patients who are admitted to the film Victor @-@ Gaffar , who come from their home and 47 % of the hospital .
access to palliative care
77 % of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care , that is to say , to care designed to alleviate the suffering when a sick man reaches the terminal stage of his life , be it at home , in the hospital or in a care centre .
and several agencies , such as the winner Victor @-@ Gbois and the home @-@ care society of the Gand Monrza , specialise almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients .
it is precisely this great lack of health care for Qéec , which makes many junior doctors aware of the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide .
since October , a manifesto signed up to an eminent care of palliative care , such as Dr Baltiur Mount and Dr Bernard Lavinte , is circulating to demonstrate his opposition to such an initiative .
according to the Draal , the Quarii Marel , the health care system of Qéec is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted with euthanasia .
&quot; recently , &quot; on the back , &quot; I saw a patient spend 14 days in Urities suffering great pain without the need to alleviate it .
I fear that patients would like to die just because they do not receive adequate care . &quot;
and at the same time , many oncologists are stubborn with their patients up to the last day , despite the worst predictions .
Hélène Richard &apos;s hopes for survival were already at a minimum when he left the treatment of exhausting chemotherapy .
&quot; when I told him to my onopvita who wanted to stop the treatment , she told me that it was a great pity that I would like to stop fighting , &quot; he brings together .
&apos;But I was told that there was nothing more to do ! &apos;
there is no all @-@ out care
it believes that 90 % of the sick who are asking to die are grateful to their carers who did not listen to them in their demands once they have been relieved of their pain thanks to a palliative care team .
it has to be said , however , that palliative care is not entirely powerful when it comes to the treatment of pain .
according to Elsie Monerau , the head of the palliative care at the home of Gand Monza , patients are not responding to the pain by 8 % of the cases .
at the end of life , doctors tend to resort to palliative lighting , which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death , whether in a sporadic or permanent way .
we cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering .
increasingly , the disease does not have the possibility of having such a palliative check .
the sick who are not relieved say all the same : &apos; I want to die &apos; .
but that does not necessarily mean to say &apos; I want euthanasia &apos; , but &apos; I want me to relieve me &apos; .
the implementation of this report was possible thanks to a grant of journalism from Canada &apos;s health research institutes .
large @-@ scale @-@ based housing in Qéec
workers on the road network , businessmen in the BPA , collecting funds from political parties and Italian mafia specialists day after day , what they know of a formidable &apos; system &apos; , which forms part of the construction industry , civil servants , politicians , trade unionists and the Mafia .
one &apos; industry &apos; which went too much to the taxpayers &apos; money , especially in the 1990 &quot; s and 2000 &quot; s .
&quot; it is curious to see how the system is dumped once we have stuck to the big media , &quot; unecza Jacques Duchesneau , a member in Qéec and former chief of the Police in Montreal .
he led to the outbreak of the scandal in 2011 , which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation of the misappropriation of road contracts in Qéec , which the prime minister of that time , Jean Charest , had no meaning but to delay .
the &apos; Duchesneau report &apos; established a direct link between industry , the illegal financing of parties and corruption between officials .
&quot; since the beginning of the research in 2010 , only the transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars in contracts , &quot; containing some of its instincts to remain on a proportional share .
the Sbonamau &quot; has already brought two mayors to the fore , &quot; he adds , while waiting to be able to &quot; demonstrate the existing ploy behind the individuals . &quot;
a permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , set up in 2011
the permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , created in 2011 , also applies to its team of auditors , researchers , and government analysts .
this unit is also working with the police officers of &quot; the adra Marwa , &quot; which , since 2009 , has made the &quot; sewage cartel &quot; moderate when it comes to reviving contracts .
in the last few weeks , the unit has carried out the register in a number of allegations of fraud and corruption on municipal positions such as Frank Zakino and Richard Martte , mayor of a town on the outskirts .
the next item on the list would be Patrick Vaima , who has just resigned from his post of Mayor of Laval , the third city of Qéec .
they are suspected of repeated bribery in exchange for public contracts .
engineers from the Montreal road network and to businessmen of Italian origin have been formally accused , such as Tony Action and Lino Zrihen .
the latter caused shock to explain to the committee the mechanics of the &quot; system &quot; of public procurement .
he himself paid for three years to 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia which transferred the money to Union Monalal , the party of the mayor , Botswana , and .
Mr Zīle distributed money to the right and sinister during the years 2000 , giving more than $ 88,000 ( EUR 68,000 ) to provincial parties , especially to the liberals in power .
he also admitted that he organised a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal Deputy Minister , Nisalie Coraniau , the former Liberal Prime Minister .
the inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
in Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of corruption worked effectively .
the committee was explained to the committee very well : in ten years the report was perfectly clear : in ten years , it received gifts , invitations to travel , golf stories , restaurants , hockey parties , and bribes of the construction sector to a total of $ 736,000 , all of which in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs caused it .
other road network officials have admitted that they received money to raise the bills by 30 % to 40 % in the form of false overtime .
moreover , an organization of the mayor &apos;s party , Martin Duaka , accused M. Traglay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers for dirty money .
as a result of these revelations , M. Taglaand resigned at the beginning of November and led Montreal to a huge crisis .
Chanel to Rouhani was one of the first Olympic policies in Montreal that sounded the alarm .
as an issuer of the district of Riviz @-@ des @-@ Pilodes , in the east of the island , it has resisted since 2010 the sale of a municipal area from $ 5 million to the promoters of a real estate boom .
70 % of electoral campaign money was dirty money
in the investigation which will finally be carried out , she ensures that she is throwing out a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system , infiltrated by a mmig , to stop the gade and catch the guilty people . &apos;
and it adds that the process is &quot; painful but positive . &quot;
we are cleaning up the wounds , but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and to be very vigilant so that dubious practices are not repeated .
how to clean up .
it is a matter of course .
Mr Duhamel , for his part , declares that &quot; officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars , &quot; but he is mainly concerned about the role of &quot; elected politicians &quot; .
on 70 % , the proportion of dirty money spent on the financing of election campaigns in Qéec , Unonesza : &quot; I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality . &quot;
the Cequel government is proposing to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but that will not change the donation , according to him , &quot; whereas electoral spending is not strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
it supports a complete review of the system of awarding public and party funding : &apos; we cannot fall lower and , with courage , will enable us to rebuild the house with stronger bases , with more controls and laws &apos; .
if this story stifles the international image of Qéec and Montreal , Mr Duchesneau invites those who would look to the mirror .
&quot; the PSG is not the Barcelona QE ! &quot;
this season has acquired a new entity with the PSG .
how would it explain this development ?
it could be explained by an individual take @-@ up , but also by the new dimension of the PSG .
large players have arrived .
let us now turn to the day on your side .
the technical staff have also brought me a great deal to me .
I am pushing me on a daily basis to raise the level of my game .
in a party , that is easier .
it is going very fast in football .
but I am not silent .
from my early stages in the pre @-@ training centre of INSPIRE to my turn by Saint @-@ Etine , I have always moved forward to leaps forward .
it is going to gain benefit from the competence being recruited by Carlo Anaiotti .
this summer &apos;s recruited are used to disputed parties of a very high level .
they know that each training is crucial .
that makes a player like me who is keen to fight and take everything .
I am very much in favour of my position , Mr Carlo Anlinotti .
he is backed up together as Claude Makelle , who played a role in the same position as I did .
is it the man who needed the team ?
of course .
it inspires respect for all the technicians .
today , no one is equal in League 1 and is among the best European trainers .
he has a great deal of experience and has won a great deal with the best clubs .
he has worked with great players .
I believe that other titles will be held in Paris .
in January I had a very reassuring conversation with him .
I had just come out of a number of injuries .
I also say that the confidence you have in me explains my good performance .
what do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season ?
in League 1 , Lyon has removed the position of leader .
but we are continuing to do so .
one of our greatest objectives is the League of champions : we have classified the end @-@ of @-@ life by @-@ turn in the end .
what is the aim of the club in this competition ?
we will try to get as far as possible .
from now on , anything can happen .
but we have a lot to say on many and very good European teams .
we want , to begin with , to end the first of our league in front of the port so as to be able to receive the return of the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art slots .
can the PSG be a great European club in the short term ?
it already has the budget ...
to become a great European club , Paris has to gain securities and be there in the long term .
that is not the case today .
at the economic level , the PSG is given its means to make this project clear .
don &apos;t win the glass in League 1 , as in the last season , would it be a great failure ?
of course , it would be a great disappointment .
this year we are going to invest all our efforts to take that title of champions .
in the last season we did not go far enough .
in May , we were disappointed , because we had the best possible conditions to end first .
we had a strong season .
we end up with 79 points .
normally , on 79 points , we should have been champions ...
but another team , the Montpeer , had a rather better season .
this year I think it will be the good .
even if large teams such as Marseilles , Lyon and Burma are fighting for the title , I believe we have the weapons to lead us .
do you believe that the resources are more expected from the PSG ?
it is normal for us to expect a lot from us if we think of what has been invested in the players we have .
we accepted it entirely .
after he won 4 @-@ 0 at home to Tyes , who still have things to reproach us , is a little frustrating .
we wonder what people are waiting for .
we will never be able to win 4 @-@ 0 every weekend .
we are not QE !
we are trying to launch a project of gambling .
a team is built in time .
in the League of champions , we have shown that we can respond and be present .
look at Manchester City who , after two seasons , has not managed to be classified as an end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ last @-@ day tables , and they too have invested a great deal !
in view of the sums invested , we would imagine at 15 points of advantage in the run @-@ up to the day .
that would be neglecting our adversaries and the French championship .
the previous season , and the Marseille and Marseilles , have been &quot; driven &quot; by this new PSG .
this shows that the League 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that , despite all the difficulties , we have ended up taking the trophy .
the PSG seems entirely dependent on the successes of Zick Hainazic .
let &apos;s do we say that we have an &apos; Zidane dependency &apos; .
that means that he can say that he is very competent and has many goals .
he has come to show that he is the League star .
and he has shown in all the teams that he has gone through that he is a big player , a world star .
we in the group respect man and the player .
he also respects the men behind him .
what he has done is truly exceptional .
this leads everyone to raise their level of gambling .
Tawth Silva , one of the best defenders of the world , also allows us to make progress .
how did you experience the Euro 2012 team with the French team ?
it was a disappointment .
he was very enthusiastic about participating in this Euroglass .
unfortunately , I was prevented from accumulating time .
I saw things there and I was strengthened .
today , I have good parties to play in the selection .
that is what I had hoped for from my chest with the &apos; leus &apos; .
we learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have exemplary behaviour today .
what view do you have from the first month of Doder Descartes at the head of the &apos; Way &apos; ?
it is getting results .
they are well placed in the classification group for the World Cup .
the selection is rigorous , close to the players and inspires to win .
as was the case with Laurent Blanc .
but I do not want to make comparisons .
the aim of this was to classify us with the Euroglass .
I hope that Doder Wałęsa will lead to the selection of Brazil .
( 1 ) on 16 October , Spain served to lay the foundations ?
that game gave us confidence .
everyone fought for everyone .
before that shock in Spain , I had not experienced such a game in the whole of my career .
with Bitcoin , pay and sell without banks ,
the opposite is true of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions , and the burdens of processing among the parties .
moreover , as often happens in the technologies , the political vision is palpable : the conviction that the current monetary system , composed of bank monopolies , leads to financial crises .
in fact , Bitcoin , invented by Sherhi Nakamward ( a pseudo @-@ scientific ) , is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars , euros , and so on , and a protocol of safe change , which allows the exchange of equal records .
around 200 000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15 000 computers from the network .
and close to a thousand websites are accepted by the Sins as donations or as a way of payment .
the share of the Scoin , having reached the top of $ 30 ( EUR 23 ) in June 2011 , fell to $ 2 a month later , before returning today to around $ 10 ( contributions have been registered on the Scoanrotet.com page ) .
it is not at all impressive when compared with global changes in real currency or financial products .
however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
in it , the Sein as &quot; the virtual currency more successfully &quot; was described as &quot; competing with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to conventional currencies . &quot;
they make a difference from other systems with virtual currency types such as &quot; credits , &quot; used to move forward in a vivid game , and can be won by playing or can buy ( and even sometimes to fly ) .
the Facebook social network also developed such a system .
but in any exchange , a central authority controls and deals with changes .
in the case of Budcoin , all the two Internet headings are at the same time the depositor of accountancy books , detectors , currency issuers and buyers and sellers .
how does this network work ?
each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic directions in the form of e @-@ mail .
a user can choose a different direction for each payment , thereby ensuring anonymity .
a set of information linked to this compromise will be signed electronically through a double @-@ key system of encryption .
the network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction .
thanks to the content of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the changes in the Sins are recorded in the public accounts book , which is disseminated throughout the network .
the key milestone is to write this new transaction in that book .
this is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on computers and the winner , a kind of provisional central banker , will have the privilege of adding that additional line .
this is a phase of file on file , in other words , the transformation of a large file on a shorter and shorter numerical footprint .
computers &apos; co @-@ gene &apos; the new transaction and add a number before &apos; ring &apos; the whole .
the aim is to find the number that offers a particular footprint ( more on the outset ) .
once that number is found , the other notwo verify easily that it is the good .
the compromise then found itself bound by the chain of other transactions , any change would change the mark .
if , in order to commit fraud , a user would like twice to pay the same money very quickly ( in less than ten minutes ) , the network would only accept one of the two transactions ; the other would be orphan , as both have different fingerprints .
the computer which will solve the challenge is 50 , 000 cocoins .
to avoid inflation , this reward is split on two regularly , with probability before the end of 2012 .
the number of carcoins in circulation is , therefore , limited to 21 million , but they are visible to Amendment No 40 , which leaves a large margin of margin .
the difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in the power of calculation .
the life of the network already has its ups and downs .
the websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bought up in deposit .
&quot; the flaw used does not affect the same protocol , &quot; ensures Pierre Noizat , who has just launched the Curum , a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network .
the ECB also takes account of the potential for a money @-@ free service as a result of this anonymous service .
but the money in cash has the same defect .
powerful actors such as WikiLeaks reject payments of this kind .
others , such as the Wordar platform , accept them .
recently , Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron , the Insiege of Weizmann in Israel , looked at the accounting book and showed that nearly 80 % of Bcoins are not circulating .
in November , &apos; giants &apos; were launched .
&quot; there was $ 30,000 &quot; , the joy of Jon Holmest , who works for Coineninalen , which makes the Budins in gold .
Mr Noizat , the author of a book Education on that currency , believes in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions .
his system , Custia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real currency ) , or to a unpaid payment , but he uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions , which make it cheaper .
the bearer , moreover , manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous .
the system is easy to implement in the shops , and they do not have to install new terminals or plunder .
it is enough to provide a guide that a telephone can &quot; terrorise and acknowledge , &quot; Mr Noizat needs to have thousands of users .
there is a general movement on the review of hierarchical systems with more horizontal systems .
&quot; it will take time for Bitcoin to prevail , but in 2013 there could be a change &quot; , predicts .
on the other hand , in its report , the ECB intends to revalue the various risks , which are now considered high if this currency is successful .
we have come out of Afghanistan .
and then ?
French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( Krasa and Surbi ) .
NATO and Americans must get out by the end of 2014 .
it is time for the Afghan army to take up its territory and for Afghans to choose their future , without expecting anything from us .
we have particularly punished Afghan peasants , whom we have seen as terrorists .
and to ourselves , with our 88 soldiers murdered , the injured and the mutilated .
the Taliban have foreign extremists and former European refugees in Pakistan , but often also with peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army , as in the Soviet times .
they want to defend their traditions , ancient and archaic , even if their causes unite the jihadists , the Pakistanis , the Arabs , the Uzbek people , or the Sami .
if the local insurgents are helped by the local insurgents , they will no longer be able to do so when the West becomes more discreet .
the departure of the French troops from the base of Njraab , which I saw from the high of the hills planted by the French funds , was done in order .
the tour of lorries and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack , monitored by helicopters .
there will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014 .
circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996 .
Kabul was then empty , and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions .
his control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation , a return to security .
the Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants over the Al @-@ Qaeda organisation , but their situation is no better today .
the old muayes , the current government , and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position .
the main personalities of the anti @-@ Soviet war returned to power in 2001 .
they have become speculators , gaining government land to sell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from the couple of huge US subcontracting contracts .
they are discredited ; most of them have not fought .
people , I have heard in the field , aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves .
many young people want to leave , as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity : capital flight is considerable .
young people are tired of war and their ideologies .
they have lived through the modern world during their homes in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their benefits .
with around 65 % of its population under 25 , Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants - one @-@ fifth of the total population .
in cities , state schools are full of girls and children .
these young people will have to be given work that will not want to go back to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders .
all of us , including the armed opposition , are eager for mobile phones : television and its saga of a modern world of a modern world have great fans throughout the country .
the army is now present .
will the authorities who want to conduct the country be considered legitimate ?
the former commanders of the anti @-@ Soviet struggle are worried about re @-@ establishing provincial militias , who will flee the power central power .
Afghanistan , a country of mountains , of strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation to the image of Western nations , but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state with strong presidential power , by removing the post of prime minister since the 1963 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want foreign control , particularly at the time of the elections planned in April 2014 .
however , your country depends on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before .
no industry has re @-@ established its services , no packaging has been sorted out and important irrigation systems have not been repaired .
everything is imported and there is nothing except fruit and vegetables .
the priority is left to private initiative .
in a country ruined after 30 years of war , government control would have been necessary .
the rumour spread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth .
and that only increases the feeling that the Westerners were there to take over them .
without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through mountains , there is no mining .
the Chinese have already almost abandoned Mynak &apos;s copper mines , leaving international neurologists ( financed by the World Bank ) to remove the immense location site and stay there as the most important employers in the province .
it will also require Afghanistan and Pakistan , a country on which imports and exports depend heavily , restore their normal relations .
French troops left on 20 November .
the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : schools of girls , schools of children , a French department at university , the French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation .
since 2009 , in order to try to &apos; win the hearts and spirits &apos; and to make the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions , a &apos; civil and military &apos; service from the Ministry of Defence ( Cilc ) , abolished in 2012 , brought with it a small number of French NGOs and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages .
these work , which has been successful in obtaining local labour , has been able to help contain the insurrection : irrigation , wells , drinking water , reforestation , fruit trees , solar protection and increased land .
what will we leave as I remember after EUR 2 million of military expenditure ?
a rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions , which are very tough in those valleys often over 2,000 metres high .
the Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Ktensa .
in order to release themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups , something that farmers have told me they want , it would be necessary to maintain a small , well @-@ controlled and directly controlled civil aid .
a Basic Law in Egypt
it is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi .
while Egypt is more divided than ever before to the constitutional declaration , which formally gives it full powers , it has decided to play everything .
they took the whole world by surprise on Wednesday when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the next day .
just a week ago , the head of state had given this House two more months to end his work .
and it is almost two years ago that Egypt has used a provisional text , which has been amended several times , which undermines institutional stability and leads to criminal acts .
this new initiative has only increased the divide in the country .
for his opponents , the president will pursue his &quot; autocratic folly &quot; and continues to &quot; betray his word &quot; and &quot; trample on the right . &quot;
on the part of its supporters , it ensures that this is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and to speed up the process of transition .
a referendum should be organised over the next 15 days .
a very short period of time forces the Brotherhood to give up its draft of explaining the text , Article by article , to the Egyptians .
for the president , this is also a way of restoring popular and democratic legitimacy as the controversial cause is raging throughout the country .
Alan Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him , as he said in an interview in the American weekly newspaper .
given that this appeal was voted very quickly , it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people : &quot; or vote for my text , or keep the full powers , &quot; powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution .
it is in that strange atmosphere in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly , in its vast majority , voted the text yesterday .
the majority of the Liberals did not go to the call .
in mid @-@ November , a little before the constitutional declaration , they had closed the door because they estimated they could not assert their views .
representatives of human rights , religious minorities and civil society did the same .
in order to achieve the necessary quorum , yesterday morning , 11 people were added to the substitute members .
some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood .
as one would have hoped , the Rules voted unanimously were unanimous .
the commentators , on the other hand , are afraid that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of the sentence , so many members of the committee came to think that the Constituent clock was wrong .
the text , which was still being voted on yesterday , consists of 234 articles .
Article 2 , which is the subject of all eyes , is still identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , which stipulated that &apos; the principles of Sharia are the main source of law &apos; .
the bourgeois parties , for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim , hoped that the principles &quot; the principles &quot; would be replaced by &quot; the rules , &quot; which would have allowed the most stringent application .
for the Islamists , the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and of their respect for the other components of Egyptian society .
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising trick .
according to them , the Islamicisation of the Constitution is made through other articles .
they relate , in particular , to Article 220 , which gives the University of Al @-@ Azar an advisory role , particularly for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with Sharia law .
according to the expert in Egypt Sophia , it is disturbing because the &quot; people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
here we can see the premises of a theocracy . &quot;
the fears of the Liberals are also increased by the fact that the next head of that university would be far less moderate than the current one .
&quot; for now , there is no particular religious involvement .
with this Constitution we are within the framework of the civilian state .
the majority of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ultra @-@ masters , but university , some of them trained in the French system , &quot; explains Alexis Delek , who prepares a thesis about Egyptian constitutional transition .
but it acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity surrounding Article 220 , as the terms used in the form of religious vocabulary follow .
&quot; we are referring in particular to the term Inqh &#91; Islamic case @-@ law ) .
the question that could arise in future would be to what extent they are the competent civilian judges to speak out above all this &apos; .
beyond its religious character , yesterday &apos;s text has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers it gives to the president of the Republic .
the Muslim Brotherhood will argue that they are few compared to those in the previous regime .
another point of contention is the powers conferred on the military .
under the desire of the military , the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament , but to a national defence council .
there will be no ban on civil prosecution in military tribunals , as the defence of human rights organisations called for .
these also expressed their concerns regarding the text , which consider the freedom of freedom .
the crime of blasphemy is maintained and , from now on , insults are banned , which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression , especially for the press .
moreover , no article emphasises the protection of women , highlights Hba Morayf of Human Rights Watch .
according to her , the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture under Article 36 .
the word did not appear in the previous Constitution .
although the Egyptian President had to leave yesterday evening on the television , there are signs that this lunchtime .
the supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday .
in Israel , Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land , the world &apos;s inward , and a sea of death .
the promised Earth combines the majliousness of biblical truths with modern comfort and a very technical nature .
&quot; AIF &quot; identified the five major reasons why Israel should visit it .
turning to the Holy Land
it is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was named .
it is thought that anyone who enters this &apos; pile @-@ up &apos; will receive divine grace .
it is the place of the miracles of Jesus : the conversion of water into wine in the wedding , walk over the waters , the appeasement of the storm , and the networks full of them .
in the same place , Jesus appeared in the aftermath of its revival after resurrection .
but the largest number of saints is in Jerusalem .
the believers are drawing here on the Viacrus or the route of the Cross of Jesus ( in Latin &quot; Way Dooran &quot; ) .
it starts in the fortress of Antonio , the Pretoria , where the trial took place and continues on the streets of the City of New City , to the Holy Kólth , the site of the crucixion , to the pedma of the mup and the place of the burial of Jesus .
in this very same place , it is also the symbolic Christian side of the world , which symbolises the salvation of humanity .
and the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem , built in the place where , according to a Christian myth , there was a tree from which the cross to the cruciification of Jesus was carried out .
in Jerusalem , it is also the place that is the most sacred place for the Jews , the Berlin Wall ; the remnants of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the 1970 &quot; s .
as it is a tradition , people of different religions leave here with their wishes , which will then become a reality .
a vertical trip
the ruins of Fortress Fortress it was what came out of a secret refuge against enemies , which Herodes the Great des wrote in the year 25 to B for his family .
they find themselves at the sea level at the sea level at the height of 450 m .
and they can only get there by their own means , only those who are engaged in escalation .
the rest of us can reach this historic summit on the ground .
and in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 @-@ 2040 , there is the famous Herenalski ski station , where there is a large influx of tourists in the winter months .
up until there , bus services are offered from the foot of the foot .
the total length of ski tracks is 45 km .
according to an old myth , at the top of the mountain , it was supposed to have paid gods .
the Pakup of museums
there are around 300 museums in the country .
in a single journey , he will not be able to visit them all .
but it is worth visiting at least five of them , the most interesting .
these include the Museum of Israel , located near the Knesset ( Israeli parliament ) .
in it , the former Manvos of the Mualar Sea of Qumwill are retained , discovered in the pins of the Juja desert , and around 500 000 archaeological and anthropoological parts .
it is worth visiting the Museum of Arte in Tel Aviv .
in his presentation of paints , he has a bit of an impressive amount of nerve and exlobbying , such as Monet , Pissey , Renento , Sisley , Sisley , Milliani , Modliani , Chaannl or Pimarried .
it is possible to visit the Al @-@ Caspian museum @-@ bathing museum , which is some rooms of ancient Turks with the model figures of visitors and bathers at the time .
it is worthwhile to go through the exclusive private museum Ralli in which we can admire the cultures of Rodin and Dalí .
there are no tourist maps or shops there .
the entry is free , and no donations are accepted .
fifth , the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv shows one of the most dramatic pages of history .
the most tragic section is Memorial of the children , built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and the gas chambers .
he and he are in complete darkness .
the stars are conspicuous .
they sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives .
Ukraine is also mentioned .
health
the three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea , the Red Sea and the Sea of the Sea .
in each of them there are swimming pools , water parks , horns and static museums .
it is curious that the Red Sea is swimming in even in the winter months , as the temperature of the non @-@ 21 degrees and the air is as high as 23 degrees .
I am even warmer in the sea , and they go there in the whole year .
incidentally , this sea , the most extraordinary in the world , is at the lowest point on the planet : 417 m under sea level .
the blue waters there are a death that easily holds up to those who do not know how to swim .
the countryside in the vicinity is truly beautiful .
people come here to move on to treated water treatment , die , perish , and boost their health in cases of derlitititis , allergies , asthma , artritis , CJD , diabetes , and order to put their damaged nerves in order .
passing on the Shadow of Age
the ancient part of Tel Aviv , the town of Jaffa , on the Mediterranean coast is preserved .
it took on the famous maritime route between Egypt , Syria , Anatolia and Mesopotamia .
the city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian people reading .
according to the story , he was here that Noé built his headscarf and Percenseo rescued the beautiful Anóaca with whom he , in this very same place , took a long and happy life .
tourists love to walk around the narrow streets that take the names of the Kodo signs .
they say that if you touch the walls on the streets of your &quot; yourself &quot; symbol , fortune will be favourable .
in Khartoum , couples of newly @-@ married couples can be found from all parts of Israel , and even from other countries to paint themselves .
and , in the Carea , the city of King Herodes , you can go through the Roman theatre , &quot; take &quot; the strength of the crusaders .
in the Roman era , Cara was the main city of Juars and the residence of the Roman practitioners , including Pontius Pilate .
the carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera spectacles .
remember to remember
if you go to Israel , do not worry if your English leave much to be desired : in this country around 30 % of the population speak Russian .
money for this journey is not advisable to lead it in euros , but in dollars , which can easily be changed to shéquels ( now 1 @-@ 3 $ , 8 shomels ) .
urban transport mainly consists of buses but , in Jerusalem , there is fast @-@ track road , and in Haifa there is the only half line in the country , which has six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City .
it is , in fact , out of a flat @-@ cut game .
travel in any form of public transport costs 6 shquels and this price can travel by transferring for 1.5 hours .
in Israel , according to the Jewish tradition , the sheet is celebrated in Israel .
from the night of Friday to the beginning of Saturday , markets and shops shut down and public transport removes their work .
but a new week of work will begin on Sunday morning .
in many cafes , restaurants , and hotels , there is only food koser , who excludes pork , marital meat , uncaged fish and meals in which milk and meat are combined .
there is a wide range of selection of meat on the basis of beef and lamb , fire @-@ keeping and post with milk , the traditional HeArea , so @-@ called coronus , a wide variety of people , the infomel , who are swimming , fruits , fruit and vegetables .
in the streets of Israeli cities , there are no street dogs .
on the other hand , there are a lot of cats who are well fed to their liking .
in the evening , you can see even the ceilings of the left cars .
there is a great deal of pleasure in the surrounding places and do not reject the dead .
the rent of a car , depending on the brand , will cost of 37 $ 37 $ 188 to $ 188 ( Audi A6 , Volvo S80 ) a day .
apart from the insurance , it comes from $ 15 per day .
and the rent of a bicycle will come from 15 shoels day .
tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shquels .
Israel in figures
in 2012 , there were more than three million tourists from all over the world in 2012 .
the majority of those who went to the country and rest were citizens of the US , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , the United Kingdom and Ukraine .
the Promeder Earth from January to October 2012 was visited by 118.8 000 Ukrainian tourists , which exceeds 51 % of the same rate for 2010 , before the visa regime was cancelled on 9 February 2011 .
&quot; the big and powerful &quot; will take you to Moscow : immigrants save the language .
as long as MEPs and defenders of human rights discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination , they have already appeared in the rogue country to trade with &quot; false &quot; certificates .
every year , 13 million migrant workers reach Moscow , St Petersburg , and other cities in Russia .
they are mostly citizens of central Asian countries : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , and Turkmenistan .
their sole aim is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home .
since 1 December , a law has come into force on 1 December , according to which every labour immigrant must carry out an examination in order to check his knowledge of the Russian language .
for now , this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector , community @-@ service institutions , domestic services and retail trade .
however , in time , as they promise in the Federal Service for Immigration , the examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants .
in addition , it will not be enough to examine the language , if not the history of Russian history and the basis of legislation .
the knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit .
the citizens of countries in which the Russian language is the official language are the exception .
people who managed to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law .
use , evil , and defence of rights
the network of screening centres will work under the Institute of Lena Russian Pushkin , the University of People &apos;s Amin the People &apos;s Prostd , the State University of Moscow , the State University of St Petersburg , and other Russian higher education institutions .
immigrants will be able to stand for evidence in all cities , now more than 160 centres of this kind are open in Russia .
the initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Service for Immigration .
but defenders of rights , long before the law came into force , have often managed to put this question to the press : and what will this actually bring ?
what changes will it make available to the knowledge of language , both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves ?
first of all , representatives of the immigration service respond , this will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering &quot; work slavery . &quot;
many people are talking today about the defence of the rights of labour immigrants , explains Victor Osman , head of the representation of the Federal Federal Asylum Service in Tajikistan .
the defence of their rights must begin before their start .
only an organised selection system will resolve the problem of immigrant workers by 90 % of the cases .
the problems are with immigrants without profession , education , those who do not know the language and do not go through medical control .
without the understanding of the language , he claims to be suffocating , the future immigrant will be condemned to finding people without scruples who , on the pretext of helping , have had a shocking and close co @-@ pay , where he and dozens of others are consumed for months without food and documents , working from 12 to 14 hours a day .
we receive a very large number of complaints from our immigrants .
&quot; in their homeland , they promise them one thing , but when they arrive , they are deprived of their passports , they are not paid to the promised &quot; wages , &quot; confirms the head of the migrant immigration service from Tajikistan &apos;s immigration service , Tomb Sharipov .
do not bother me !
however , as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognise that they do not only do not know the language of the country they are seeking to go to , but they also write with difficulty in their own language .
of course , this is not so much his guilt , but his own misfortune : there are few blind people who have the luxury of receiving normal primary education .
this is because their families have nothing to feed the children , let alone wear them , keep them out and buy what is necessary for school .
by getting to young people , these boys venture to work at the earliest opportunity .
it is difficult , if you do not know the language , you recognise them .
&quot; you feel humiliated and inferior . &quot;
however , as far as the law of language is concerned , the defenders of rights point to an important point .
the examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal .
if they do not have this status , there will be no examination and , as a result , no official work .
meanwhile , the majority of migrant workers still live in Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome or forbidden the move to strangers . &quot;
many visitors say that receiving official status in our country is not so easy .
the reason lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself .
moreover , the legalisation costs money : from 12 000 to sixteen thousand rubles .
however , a false registration can be done quickly and for just a thousand hundred thousand .
the Russian police staff know that we usually have false documents , we are not listed and cases of extortion appear .
&quot; we are asked for a hundred or two hundred clouds for cigarettes or tea , &quot; he told journalists the citizen of Tajikistan , Umed Hushkadov .
&quot; we are , don &apos;t be just a matter of the time , buy a paint . &quot;
the first day of the entry into force of the law on language , it became clear that not just documents of registration of immigrants can be false .
a number of &apos; false &apos; certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by civil @-@ immigration officials .
counterfeit documents had been printed in colour standards .
of course , they arrived at the hands of the new owners not as a gift : every immigrant , he wanted to facilitate the task of passing the evidence , he paid for the seven thousand rubles .
this is two and a half times more expensive than the official screening procedure , which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles .
the main task for the near future is to protect the anti @-@ corruption system so that &quot; diplomas &quot; cannot be bought , government officials and rights defenders converge .
so far , the authorities can promise migrant workers that they would not have been successful in examining the first time to study the basic course of the language .
moreover , Russian @-@ speaking immigrants will be offered work that does not require active communication with the people .
the Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic action against the illegal trade in weapons .
the proportion of crimes committed with registered weapons is fairly small .
the Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigid in relation to the owners of weapons of civil use .
this is the reaction of the government in the recent incidents : to press fire at marriage celebrations in which , fortunately , there were no victims , and the massacre initiated by the lawyer , Dimitjjjjki Vinopidov , in which he put up seven people who lost their lives .
the police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to raise the minimum age for licensing for arms from 18 years to 21 years .
this idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption , Iina Yarouaya , who promised that the laws on arms possession will be taken to the State Duma in the near future .
not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the &apos; hard @-@ hand policy &apos; .
in the network , an open letter has appeared , whose authors , representatives of various social organisations , are demanding that these measures &apos; unmeaning strictness &apos; measures be thrown out .
the percentage of acts of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal , he commented on the BBC news service of Russia , the criminalise lawyer Vasiliy Lwkov .
according to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior , six months of 2012 committed 142 crimes with the use of firearms registered in the interior , as opposed to the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period .
the authors of the open letter are certain that stricter legislation in the civil weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the criminal to turn to the black market .
now , according to his words , any weapon can be found in Moscow at a lower price .
meanwhile , the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation regarding the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control .
suppliers : from factory to official
the black market in weapons is supplied through various channels .
the main channels are years , it says the Colonel Victor Barannets , who , for ten years , worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High State Mayor .
seal screen on the website that accepts the orders of weapons
the first , &quot; relic of the army or military &quot; - that is , the weapons that were stolen during military action in the Caucasus .
&quot; the weapons were swept away by Russian officials and the same Caucasian , &quot; says Barannets .
the next kind of &apos; black weapon &apos; , stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces .
it explains to the House that the weapons released from police stores and those stolen directly by officials from law enforcement bodies are included here .
illegal weapons go out to sale from military arsenals .
in many military arsenals , there were often explosions .
&quot; there are proven versions that some fires were deliberately caused to cover the absence , &quot; he says an exmilitary .
according to Barannets , the arms manufacturers also play their part .
&quot; now private factories of weapons that are not competitive on the international market and distribute low @-@ market weapons on the black market , including Moscow , &quot; the expert says .
one more source of the black market is smuggling .
a large number of guns and gun machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan .
&quot; there is their own production , sometimes small , and there has been a mafia which has organised the flow of arms &apos; , explains the former military .
where do the weapons come from ?
the experts have calculated what the participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal arms to the black market is .
a report on this subject was drawn up in 2011 by the centre for analysis of public management problems and planning .
the specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and from Rosstat , biometrics and public access data , the subject of which is subject to arms .
the vast majority of illegal weapons , according to researchers , come from the armed forces and the security forces .
half of the arms of the black market has gone there &apos; through officials whose work is related to arms &apos; , it says in the report .
according to researchers , 17 % of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts , 14 % of cases are stolen during arms production and 5 % corresponds to &apos; illegal archaeological &apos; .
the dependent on one of the arms shops , who asked for its surname not to be mentioned , says that weapons found by illegal defectors have not been bought for a long time because they are too old .
they often say , suppliers run to military stores when they need a departure .
on the contrary , the supplier is buying a unit , such as an FTT .
they remove the registration and pass it over the fence .
&quot; this leads the city to the city and sells it to EUR 900 per unity with two chargers , &quot; we know .
&quot; but , of course , the police on all issues , so regularly , when the plan to discover crimes is to be complied with , makes testing purchases of illegal arms traders , &quot; adds the dependent .
&quot; as in a luxury wedding &quot;
the seller and the purchaser often find themselves through known .
&quot; I visited Web pages and blogs until a type that I proposed was the &quot; Begouaya &quot; platform , where I would be a man who would lead me into a &quot; lens &quot; where we could negotiate .
at the price of the weapon , I learned only there . &quot;
military Viktor BaranT
&quot; to get a gun I need a friend who is in contact , &quot; says the shop @-@ dependent . &quot; I have a friend of this kind , but I do not hope much in him . &quot;
there are sellers in the markets , but there , too , we must go , say , &quot; on the part of Mr Iversen , who asked that he should be told that his daughter had been thrown into a tooth &quot; .
I can even achieve a couple of coal @-@ fired power through a person of confidence .
he , too , is supplying me to me because he knows that I am not going to fill it .
viewers are seeking arms in different ways .
the former military Viktor Barannets was tested on the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid @-@ 1990 &quot; s , when an article on this subject was available .
according to your words , the schemes have not changed .
he gave him an albm of photos where there was no &apos; for everything &apos; .
&quot; I felt as in a luxury , &quot; recalls the military .
in the words of Barannets , the buyer does not offer you the wool over the eyes of the buyer : everything that can be proven .
I , as a potential customer , are not only buying or who we are with the seller , where we set a target .
&quot; you give me the opportunity to shoot , and when I can assure you that the weapon is shooting up well , we are starting to negotiate , &quot; describes the expert procedure .
death penalty
the Web search engines lead to sites and groups of &apos; Vkonakte &apos; , where it is offered to buy arms &apos; for different purposes &apos; .
this does not require any documents or personal meetings .
&quot; it is enough to have a certain amount of money , &quot; write in the title of the advertising notice &quot; understand a gun or a gun machine . &quot;
there are users of users making their orders and asking questions .
and sell to minors ?
&apos; without permission &apos; , of course , the user &apos; Ián &apos; ( ortography ) .

I have heard from these systems : generally , the website is recorded outside the scope of Russian laws .
people make orders .
the buyer makes the payment through an automatic car .
&quot; in response , you send you a photo and the instructions so that you know where the weapon is hidden , &quot; the NGO secretary of the press &quot; brings up the right to arms &quot; , Dmitri Kisangani .
Viktor Barannets says that if a request is made in line , one is left without a weapon and put it in prison .
the Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two hands to those who want to buy firearms .
&quot; and people go , as fish starving to the trap , and then to extract coal in Siberia , &quot; he claims .
of the $ 100 ov of the Wage
in the purchase of illegal firearms , according to the experts , one can spend 100 @-@ 900 dollars .
according to the NGO &quot; The right to arms &quot; NGOs Dmitri Kisangani , a gun can be bought by 100 @-@ 300 dollars .
we must wait for a month and a half .
it has been sent from military stores by middle @-@ ranking bosses .
according to official ministry statistics , compared to January @-@ October 2011 , the total number of these crimes in Russia was cut by 7 % , accounting for 900 % , and the number of identified cases of arms theft , munitions , explosives and explosives fell by 7.8 % .
the workers of rapid food restaurants and supermarkets in the US are on strike .
even a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as machines in &quot; McDonald &apos;s &quot;
in recent days , a wave of protest has begun in the United States against the low @-@ wage wages of the Walt supermarket and in the restaurants of popular fast @-@ food chains , such as &quot; McDonald &apos;s &quot; , &quot; Burer King , &quot; &quot; Thal Bell &quot; , &quot; Wendin &quot; and &quot; Wendon &apos;s &quot; and &quot; Kentucky Chicken . &quot;
for now , no one dares to claim whether or not this wave will reach the nine points , or whether it is intended to lose forces and love its early stages .
the protest actions are supported by the trade unions and on a number of left @-@ wing NGOs .
in addition to the increase in the modest wages received by the workers of Walscht and those of the fast @-@ food system , the aim of the organisers of the protests is to create labor unions in these companies .
for now , this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement .
cuts and six cents a year ?
the actions began last week , after the one @-@ day action day , the so @-@ called &quot; Black Friday &quot; - that day , in the United States , the cut @-@ off orgy that captured millions of inhabitants , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
on the day , some workers from the SWalt , who employ 2.2 million people in the world , abandoned their jobs and formed a protest match , together with the unions and left @-@ wing activists in the corporation shops , whose products are directed to people of modest , moderate income .
declare sells everything , from infancy , hunt and batteries for cars , to aspiring eggs , eggs , and milk .
products in their shops are on average between 8 % and 27 % cheaper than those of the larger supermarkets .
that is why many workers who are poorly paid from Walt are buying only on work .
the availability and product mix have made Walt one of America &apos;s largest corporations .
according to two critics , Walét can afford to sell goods at a very low price , partly because he pays little to his workers .
the latter also complain about poor working conditions , such as the lack of sparararararararge or hand scanners .
that &quot; Black Friday &quot; the demonstration participants demanded the rise in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 @-@ 100 dollars a month .
for a typical worker of Walt , who receives $ 9.5 per hour , this spending is excessive , they said .
scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walt increases the average wage up to 12 $ 12 per hour , this will cost the corporation $ 3.2 trillion .
that is about 1.1 % more than it spends on wages now .
if Walt puts the increase in consumer shoulders on the consumer &apos;s shoulders , every visit to the shop will cost them only 46 cents more expensive .
in a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12 $ 39 more than they are now spending .
Walt &apos;s supporters are satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation .
the &apos; Black Friday &apos; went on in its shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day and , during that time , Walét sold around 5 000 articles per second .
in total , its &quot; Black Friday &quot; had its &quot; Black Friday &quot; carried out in its &quot; Black Friday &quot; .
the company &apos;s representative , Dan Jarelman , declared in an interview to the left @-@ left Web site Hufifton Post , who left their job &quot; less than five &quot; President Walscht , and that the protest had been no more than &quot; another public @-@ relations trick , &quot; organised by the workers &quot; union .
&quot; it is free ! &quot;
the protests continued this week in New York , in which the targets were not precisely the great stores Walt ( which in this progressive city does not appreciate them , and so there are no , for now , no , but &quot; McDonald &apos;s &quot; and other cheap restaurants .
McDonald &apos;s says that it sells billions of pieces , and then does not even give it down and do not pay for your honest work !
the Tmaada Williams , a member of the New York City Council
currently , according to federal law and New York &apos;s law , the minimum wage is 7.25 $ per hour .
fast @-@ food restaurants are increasing over time , but only slightly , on average , ordinary workers receive in New York 8.2 dollars per hour .
no one earns less than they do in this city .
how it is possible to survive in New York with that money , for me , is incomprehensible .
there was a time when almost one quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald &apos;s and worked there , behind the show @-@ time , after school , even after the school , even though they were still living with their parents .
few people saw this as the main source of income or plan to stay there for a long time .
now , constantly in some interviews with the workers of McDonald &apos;s who complain that they have to live on this salary , and sometimes even feed their children .
on the other hand , there is a comment in a forum for the Wall Street Journal , whose author says it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know how to feed him .
the participants in the protests , which began at 6 : 30 on Thursday , in the McDonald &apos;s of 405th Street and Mingare Avente , called for fast @-@ food cash machines to be paid at least 15 $ 15 per hour , that is to double their current minimum wage .
it also demanded that the labour trade unions be created in the fast @-@ food sector .
the US law prohibits the administration from preventing this right from being punished , and activists from the trade union movement with intent and redundancies .
moreover , the administration rarely makes life easier for them .
but , for objective reasons , it is easy for trade unions to cover the food industry quickly .
one of the most important is the excessive turnover of staff .
the Republic of the European Parliament
the same day occurred in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
the completion of the action took place in the middle of the cut in the McDonald &apos;s located near Times Singare , in which a number of local democratic politicians took part , in particular the city of the city of the town , Jmaadajadlia , who said : &quot; McDonald &apos;s says that it is selling billions of pieces , and then does not even give a hospital or pay for its honest work . &quot;
the demonstrators were supported by other prominent Democratic Democrats in New York , for example the nominee for Mayor of the company Bill de Bsiu , who said that &quot; we must support workers in the fast @-@ food sector so that they can get fair wages and the economic prosperity that is deserved every neo @-@ alkali . &quot;
as the New York Times described it , this has been the largest manifestation of this kind in the American history of fast food .
but there were only a few hundred people involved , even not all of them were employees of the fast @-@ food service , in which tens of thousands of people in New York were at work .
it is still not clear whether this will serve as a spark for a massive movement .
&quot; for now , deceiving the brain is not so easy &quot;
the issue of the increased reality , which is so popular among modern technologies , has recently been perceived largely by normality through the prism of special glasses .
at the beginning of the summer , in its annual conference Google showed a model in movement and then , in November , it was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to call for a corresponding patent .
however , from a conversation with the head of the interactive technology group 3D in Microsoft &apos;s Microsoft laboratory , Izi Sharamom , it was made clear that for the scientists from that company , glasses already belonged to a past stage .
they are attracting the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with naked hands and the creation of open spaces .
- Commissioner , generally speaking , what is the subject of the study of your group of inquiry ?
- We are dedicated to the interaction of a computer , but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction .
for now , humanity in its great mass has been caught up in the working time with the fingerprints of the flat screen , sometimes the nail on the finger .
however , we would like to look forward 5 @-@ 10 years from the point of view of the cardinal changes in this interaction .
for example , the rubber @-@ page Xx and Mr Kinnock represent a step forward and , today , no Xx is sold without rumour , because they are all interested in checking by gestures .
what is the future ?
- Despite Mrs Kinnock &apos;s interaction at physical level , much of it still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
the introduction of information has improved ( the system receives more data ) , and the way out is not yet very good .
we are trying to change this , we are working in truly three @-@ dimensional sense systems , based on different technologies , including design .
the computer world must be released to our own , to physics , to make it more tangible .
for this , however , it is necessary to recognise not only the user , but also the space surrounding it .
then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way .
first of all , to the devil of those fools of virtual reality !
what do you think about state control ?
a very popular detail , but do you not think that you do not think so ?
- Unfortunately , you cannot be regarded as a panacea , we still have to resolve the issue of privacy , because we do not always want the others to learn from our actions and intentions .
in fact , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own camp .
for example , in the control of devices in public places , we had a project in which we thought of gestures , but not of loose movements but shorter .
moreover , the gestures were caught not by the settlement of the device , but by a trick on the movement of bones and muscles .
for now , it is very large , but in theory it may be reduced to the size of a needle watch .
but , in general , the future is for a combined type of control , for example a gesture + .
how is this that ?
I would like to ask you , for example , how I would ask you to pass it on to you ?
you will speak and show you at the same time .
I am only talking .
. - That is going to be very difficult to recognise .
do you want to force users to adapt to what can or cannot at the moment do the machine ?
it does not necessarily , but it is a mutual rapprochement .
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensational ones that can accurately determine the people &apos;s reactions .
these can , for example , be sensory , as they provide a good resolution in depth , which is very important .
if we are talking about your work with the intuition of Xx Kinnock , what complaints do you have from the modern cameras ?
is there a lack of resolution , depth or something else ?
- In principle , today &apos;s generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three @-@ dimensional recognition .
of course , it would be a good thing to obtain 8 mega @-@ houses at the speed of 1000 devices .
but the question is not on the mega @-@ honey , but on the quality of the parent and in the depth .
from this point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us ; that gives more work to the designers of algorithms .
so we have to remember not only the X axes and but also Z.
the speed , the number of tables per second , is also important .
human movements are fairly dynamic , and the current 30 of them are truly scarce , especially for gestures .
the Battle of our laboratory in Mr Battle , on our laboratory , made a mockery of contact to be adjusted from 1 to 100 km , and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensory produced is closer to the second value ( 60 @-@ 100 ) .
not everyone understands the extent to which this affects the interaction of man and machine .
I would be very helpful to my work if I had such a device , but that does not require contact with the second to be more specific .
is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras ?
- The Kinnock now has three &apos; cameras &apos; , one of which is in actual fact the issue of the issuing of an unduly long @-@ standing issuer , and the second the recipient of the signal is reflected .
but the third chamber is in fact a mere sensory of the visible break .
this is not used to determine the depth of the object .
potentially , more cameras could solve the problem ...
on the contrary , it will increase it and increase the required amount of calculations .
it would be a good thing to create a flexible analogous of Mariect , to play with the cure of the cameras and to see how this would help to determine the three @-@ dimensional position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft , unlike Google , has not presented its glasses to the public .
do you not think that , from the point of view of the daily use of increased technology , glasses are one of the most visible platforms ?
of course , it is not very comfortable to spend all of time on an intelligent phone in our hands , but I am not thinking : the best option would be to &apos; cross @-@ empt &apos; when , on the basis of a cloud platform , you could move from glasses to the smart telephone ,
glasses are very personal devices , and that is their strength ( private things will only be able to see them ) , but also their weakness : an increased reality on the ground will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with others .
let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual printed objects on the air is available not only to Tony Stak of the film &quot; Ion Man &quot; but to any simple deadly .
there is a problem in this idea that critics often point out : there is no televised answer !
hands do nothing !
what answers does your group prepare for this challenge ?
- In my conferences , I often say that the increased reality is the seventh step in the interaction between man and machine .
I think the eighth could well be the addition of theological feelings .
meanwhile , one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for image .
it is perfectly compatible with you !
but there are also technologies that are genuinely aimed at bringing tangible to these &quot; images in the air , &quot; for example , the interference of several vague rays aimed at a specific point where the finger is given a similar sense to which one feels if someone was blowing up on my fingers , but that feeling is still very weak .
there is also a promising direction for the dory for the dogto have an influence on the nervous ends of my fingers .
has he tried to deceive the brain ?
do you think he feels what he seems to be feeling at the time he sees something ?
that is a good idea , we have not tried it yet .
there is another challenge here that we will have to fight for a long time , how to make a very small person in a very low space , is going into an open space , almost without end , and we are also working on the idea of the machines of running ( not like those in the science ) , mobile platforms , as well as the giants .
for now , deceiving the brain is not so easy , but work still needs to be done for many years .
that is what makes work with the virtual reality attractive to researchers , that many things are in a state of total conception .
subjective staff rather than culture - Rosbalt.Well .
&quot; Rosvert &quot; continues the &quot; Benghazi of St Petersburg , &quot; devoted to citizens who are in front of us , in the vanguard of art and culture .
on this list of the best , they are brilliant figures in the art and the scene from St Petersburg , whose achievements go beyond the city : they often recognize in Europe without even being known to Russia .
the new hero of &quot; Rosbalt &quot; is the bizarre artist Kyll Miller .
the entire city is aware of Kyll Miller , a budycdo man in the top down , which can be found close to the Russian Museum , close to the Verden of Vero , or in fashionable meetings and opening meetings .
Murmansk &apos;s tables always attract crowds , where they want to be displayed .
Mr Miller is one of those purely socio @-@ philosophers of St Petersburg , who is the creators of new myooms .
of course , Mr Miller is a brilliant representative of the daring of St Petersburg in the late 1980 &quot; s - the early 1990 &quot; s .
it is also an urban man , whose appearance on the streets of the city arouses a smile and raises all the mood .
recently , he took up an organization in his hands and became the site of St Petersburg , as he has matured to make such a difficult role , owing to his misrule , philosophy , and image .
if you are off , why are you going for the city in the clothes of red rather than on the yellow or like that , for example ?
- I chose the red colour because I am a fashionable engineer and I have been involved in the appearance and the image .
in this world , red colour is a compromise between the artist , the creators of images and society .
although , in society , anything that is not a little grey gives rise to aggression and property turmoil .
but my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation .
the whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate .
when do you understand that you should be an artist ?
- In an exhibition from the Culture Palace Nevsky , where my work was shown .
I realised that this was my way .
then the tide of old non @-@ official artists was over , and the new , free as I am , were still not understood .
I was a friend of artists in the new wave , with the subsequent ones being exposed in Gaza and Nevska , which led to &apos; Pushkininaya @-@ 10 &apos; , and the new wave already ended .
I sat in the theatre for clothes , the music of all genders , but not of the letters .
- and all of this was put together in your Corlic art ... - For me , it was important to be in the cultural centre of St Petersburg , where the best creative minds were to be brought together .
in 1995 , I had a land in Pushkuskaya @-@ 10 and there were no reforms , there was a musical artistic club , a wedding club , the house of the St Petersburg wedding .
many were born there : Noms , Tequel Jelz , I recall the way Schnur brought the project to the &quot; EGogh of Van Gogh . &quot;
Schnur , and his friends shouting light songs under Pohr , were in line with them , including the current fashionable photograph Igor Vdovin .
when the group began to touch alive , it became &quot; Lena &quot; .
Bachtenberg was encouraged by many programmes before the era of Hali @-@ gvobvh .
we gave Trachtenberg and the start of his great career ; the basic education and training received from us .
&quot; D 137 , &quot; the &quot; Bareredov Club , are the remnants of the Arring of the Arte .
there were our employees and continuous customers .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
in 2000 , the survey was in the press , the prize was &quot; The people of our city . &quot;
in the &apos; artist in the Year &apos; nomination I was elected , so my culmination has ended .
in these new times it is not comfortable to work ; I am a man who likes the truth , honesty and culture in the past century .
in our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are separate ; one can be popular but very unreliable .
- There is something recognisable in your work .
- Many of my paints are enormous , the current situation and the occurrence are clearly expressed .
I am going to make a planned exhibition , &apos; The Russian Museum on clowos &apos; .
those who have taken the floor are a semi @-@ committal category .
I was previously sociological , but now it is painful and frightening .
however , in the so @-@ called &apos; all @-@ out &apos; , the tragedy is being eliminated .
I love the grotesque , I have grotesque ideas .
for example , the salvation of the world by means of a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes .
now they are still being followed by clothes on the outside , but not within the person .
and perhaps he should not be given the hand , but he should not give him the hand , but to hide in the face .
and the deception will be eliminated when the clothes are changed .
they recently saw us in the role of urban ground organisation . - A hero must have such a hero .
who is better than me ?
well , but can the art of commerce be beautiful ?
- The art of trade must now be scrupulous , fresh , calm .
we are witnessing the disintegration of cultures .
people joined in the back of the day , in the run @-@ up to the bush , the people wanted one thing , the simply others .
now all of them have divided into micro @-@ communities , it is difficult to please all .
I am not a $ 100 ticket to like everyone .
now we need to think about who you want to imagine .
now every hero of worship has his 100 fanatics .
- and to listen to Sites Mikko arrive on thousands of thousands !
- You are going to see those abandoned , the gender @-@ social area works .
there are 300 000 people in a cultural event , 10 000 will never happen ; as a result , less management , less money and nothing more than money .
I have the most important thing to do , and not to deceive them , not to lose what you have achieved .
when he was young , he made such tricks that a collection of the wall crossed on the wall at the side of Chak and Valonov .
I began with paints , with which people usually end .
now they often confuse the concepts .
they say spiritual culture , the culture of consumption .
there is no culture in consumption , that is another story .
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture , I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and were in poverty , denied money only to paint tables .
I am in favour of this culture .
if you are not , what is missing from St Petersburg ?
- Good experts in culture .
there is a concept : civil servant .
but not all of them can go to culture .
when kings were the right thing in another way , kings perhaps did not buy culture very well , but they knew that the right experts had to be kept .
there are very good consultants now in Moscow .
we have people in St Petersburg who could well be experts , but they are closed , because experts are needed at a higher level than to properly assess them and open their way .
now it is thriving the subjective personal taste .
the same pill , but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted , there are some artists who have to look for other museums .
what is it for Mr St Petersburg ?
- Saint Petersburg is not a cultural capital ; there is much more culture in Moscow , there there is land .
but on our stones it is difficult for art to grow .
we need cultural terrain and we now have more writers than readers , that is wrong .
in Europe , there is a lot of people with curiosity that will go to exhibitions and concerts .
in our case , this is a tiny class .
we have to make the art of fashion , as it was at the beginning of the last century .
the project will be implemented with a grant from St Petersburg .

filling in space vessels with human on board is based on the search for a spare planet .
to preserve humanity , the main question is : how can we continue the species under conditions of intaxed or on the same planet of spare ?
I think there is little to choose .
in fact , only two are true planets that can be colonised , at least to a default .
&quot; these are Vuons and Mars , &quot; says the researcher in the astronomical State Institute , Strberg P.K , Vladimir London .
but if the conditions on Mars are better for life , the temperature surface is 500 degrees .
it is only right to live up to large highlands or in the orbit of Vanns - in space .
reproductive problems have begun to be addressed in space with flora .
it is already half a century since experiments on plants were carried out .
four generations of thyroid grown in orbit have nothing to distinguish from land varieties .
then it came to the breeding of insects in the orbit , small flies in fruit , the drain .
in 1979 , quiet eggs were sent to space in order to check how the embryo develops under conditions of inerliquidity .
we can see that this is normal .
but then there are problems .
&quot; the problem is that you have to find support , you have to stand on your own feet , and start moving , &quot; the leader of the Institute of the Institute of Russia &apos;s Academy of Sciences , explains Vladimir Sychev .
by failing to find support , polluice gave birth to chance .
and after 10 hours in the newborn babies , there was a total drain on instincts .

and the misfortune was that after four days they were simply dying .
&quot; and twice we managed to come up on the ground , but then let us leave it because it was impossible to work there with them , &quot; says Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment in space .
the last time a biological &quot; mini &quot; ran into orbit 16 years ago .
in the spring of 2013 , experiments will continue .
however , in the &apos; Bion &apos; elite , &apos; Bion &apos; will only travel species of the same sex .
there was an experiment with rats , which were sent to space with unborn children .
in principle , nothing was found to be far @-@ fetched .
&quot; this was precisely in the biosatarelites , but this was a unique experiment , and studies such as this must be carried out , &quot; commenting Vladimir Sychev .
after the landing , space rats had offspring .
however , the problem of reproduction has still not been tackled directly in space .
this is a difficult challenge .
animals , by losing their usual habitat , simply cannot carry out their sexual instinct .
man , however , unlike small animals , can , in principle , be able to do so .
you have the abstract reasoning and you are capable of creating an appropriate emotional fund .
similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons .
but women have been travelling in space for 50 years now .
the greatest risk has gone on from the Middle East .
and the most precious humanity is the female body .
we went on to fly , and nobody on earth could say : if it is after a flight into space .
you can or will not have a baby after this flight .
&quot; after all , to this question , no one has replied , &quot; he says the old aerospace sector &apos;s old aerospace industry .
in June of 1964 , only after one year of the space flight , the first crowded woman , Radina Tereshkova , gave birth to a daughter .
the father of the girl , Cáan Nikolev , was also a beacon .
in 1988 , the second vibrant woman , Svewool @-@ wool , who was twice in orbit and even worked in the open space , had a child .
however , the risk persists .
there are few of them , and the astronauts are numbered who , after long flights , has done well , and a healthy generation has grown .
&quot; and if it can be said more , it is dangerous even on empty flights such as &quot; to sum up the bright pilot , a hero of the Soviet Union , a hero of Russia , Valacshyov .
however , humanity must look for some new ways in biotechnology , in radiological protection , in creating the artificial gravity .
the water water in the Centre for Living and Drug Addiction is a compulsory stage in the preparation for the flight .
in conditions of null and void , the cosmomontas practice their working skills in space .
water is pretending to be ineffective .
if water is adult , it is a comfortable , but still hostile , environment for a newborn child as its native element .
the small men @-@ married men seem to confirm that life in the land came out of the ocean .
there is a connection between the fact that the baby is to find approximately 9 months in its mother in amniic liquid , because it will be easier for it to then get used to water .
in principle , this is logical because from the time of birth up to the time of the first bathing passes only 2 weeks .
&quot; this is too little to forget about something , &quot; he says Navy Navy , the mono of swimming of newborn babies .
in short , if the intaxed is a more natural state for a newly born , it is necessary for women to hang on , the strength of gravity .
the ability to expel the foetus is reduced in the untaxed muscles and the race in the cold .
well , let us stop that , relying on the action of encouragement for childbirth .
it may , of course , be possible to give birth in a special chamber , it will push it .
&quot; what ? &quot; the original question has been put forward .
on the other hand , the child also needs artificial gravity .
without a sense of gravity , the body does not generate the fissile system or the muscle system .
it is impossible to wear a single into orbit with a special suit for training , such as adults .
he will simply be deprived of what is vital to him .
&quot; and this experiment that we are going to do together , by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment , will mean that we bring the earth to a disabled , a completely unadapted person , &quot; provides for the head of the Ethics Committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Ior Pfov .
for now , the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue .
but , over time , this will become a reality , when humans on their ships turn to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space .
head of NKW : inspection of the &apos; šisc &apos; system has not given the political culprit .
in the area of public procurement , the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation , even though its implementation is a step in the right direction .
this is stated by Milošević &apos;s vice @-@ president , Vice @-@ President of the Supreme Control Office .
&quot; the law will never be perfect , &quot; but its implementation must be right . &quot; this is , in my view , what we lack &quot; it describes the current situation .
joint checks by the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions .
as an example of incorrect practice , it mentions the attitude of Aučas as an example to the system of being autonomous only on paper , which is known as the &apos; šisc &apos; system .
the prime minister recently said that the SDGs ( Civil Democratic Party ) would not offend employers with inspectors ; then , is it prohibited or allowed ?
&quot; the law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything , then neither the president of the government can prevent the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor to demand obligations , &quot; notes kala .
at the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control in the Congress of Deputies , he spoke of the joint draft between the Czech and German team , in the context of which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared .
what exactly is it ?
this is a parallel check which we started a couple of years ago .
to put it in a simplified way : European legislation regulates how public procurement is to be organised , and this applies to the legislation in place in each country and then the practice itself .
we have united everything and , although control is not yet over , we have had very interesting differences and , generally speaking , our country &apos;s legislation is &apos; stricter and more comprehensive &apos; , but concrete practice in Germany is better .
it therefore confirms that it is not enough to incorporate ever more stringent rules , but that it is necessary to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself .
what does this project do , and what do you think are the conclusions ?
only a common monitoring of this kind could help us to stop investing efforts in the shape of laws , the reduction and improvement of limits , although this does not have such a positive impact .
the economy of savings means achieving an appropriate thing at a reasonable price ( which does not always mean that the price is the lowest ) in order to avoid enrichment and , in the long run , criminal actions .
but it is not because of the fact that we are going to reduce the limit on the allocation limit .
perhaps because the system is saturated with so much &apos; red tape &apos; , that those who want to look for failures in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the limits were as high as they are now .
he talks about our country &apos;s problems with the transfer of legislation which regulates the practice of public procurement .
how does the system of controls work in Germany ?
is it a office that is similar to our NKab , or is it being organised otherwise ?
when it comes to offices , such as the NKW , there is the Bundesrat , with an organisation similar to ours , with a college too , but in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way , but in principle both offices are developing in parallel .
the powers are also to some extent analogue , however , while Germany has a federal organisation , the courts are even at this level ; it differs slightly from our system .
the Federal Court of Auditors ( BH ) can only control federal money , which is what we call state funds .
the public funds , which are administered by the regions and municipalities , in Germany , are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors .
as for local legislation , is it simpler than ours ?
in general , I would not like to draw up a comparison with no specific data ; however , Germany is still a model in some respects , but it cannot be specified exactly where it is best .
could it be better , for example , in the quality of the inspectors ?
I certainly do not , but I do not like to make comparisons of this kind .
it must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face up to a great many problems .
if it were not , then it would not be any benefit to work with our office , does it not think that ?
with regard to the law of our country , what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean , to the office , what was the effect ?
bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , it has not yet been stated in the monitoring activities .
as we have carried out ex @-@ post controls , there is a certain amount of delay to be found .
for the time being , it is noted in the process of preparing for future controls : we have started a new tool to &apos; detection of non @-@ economic risks &apos; , which means that we have had almost 14 000 public concessions , which have been analysed .
does he consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that , rather , it is a mess for the bureaucratic system ?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction , and I hope that this will be the case .
the problem that may arise is that the rules &quot; tighten up &quot; and that it is impossible to comply with it .
under the previous legislation , the controlled people were linked to the contractor ( for example , in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council ) , and every non @-@ respected law on public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline .
does it make sense then to tighten up the law in this way ?
I do not think so .
the system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal ruling , which does not have an impact on decision @-@ making .
such a system will only lead to greater bureaucratic pressure .
and how do you go out of that ?
we will see where this path takes us .
the prime minister recently stated that the SDGs would not offend employers with controls on the so @-@ called šisc system , with reference to being self @-@ employed only on paper : what does this mean ?
is it banned or permitted ?
the law must be regulated in some way and , if it prohibits something , then even the prime minister of the government can not prevent the office that is obliged to carry out such controls and demand obligations .
you can say : &apos; we change the law and we allow it &apos; , but it cannot say that we will do as if it is not .
in the law on public procurement , the regulation is quite strict with regard to the way in which it is to be acted upon , and that is how it should be in order to protect public competence .
on the other hand , however , it is tragic that the candidate is excluded from the best offer on the grounds that it does not meet the formal requirements .
the law will never be perfect , but its implementation must be correct , in my view , what we lack .
roads are ice sheets , even if they are in the majority of them .
in a number of places in the Czech Republic , roads present ice and snow plates .
although most of the avenues are feasible , caution should be taken in some areas .
region of Karward and Varosha
today morning on the morning , the roads in the Karward region and Varosha were forged , but they presented ice and snow plates .
the temperature is falling and will vary between five and 10 degrees under zero .
it has stopped slipping into the region , and in the low areas the snow layer is fine .
on the other hand , the snow of the Montes Meelks is almost 30 centimetres .
in some places , visibility was still bad because of the fog , according to information at the road control centre in the region .
the fast @-@ track R6 and the first @-@ class road in the region are now at a standstill without any restrictions .
however , caution is also recommended , especially in a few bridges whose surface can be dry and slippery .
similarly , all avenues of second and third category , including mountain roads , are also eligible .
in some of these , however , there are still sections with ice @-@ of @-@ the @-@ ice and snow remnants .
there is a need to increase road attention , especially in the higher areas .
region of Parhesitate and the Helec Kazulin
in some of the roads in Bohemia there is a danger of snow and in higher areas and in the mountains , there may have been a stretch of snow on the road , it reports the road and motorways Directorate .
road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets , especially in the highest areas in the Parhesitate region .
there may well be a wind in the vicinity of the Lškroone , the Nad Oruí , Poličky , Serüford or Vysokéo Musta , and , above all , on the second and third class roads .
roads I / 43 and I and I / 34 in Sita have been treated in a vicious way .
there is snow , especially on the mountains of Krkonoše to Castké Hory .
there is a flood of snow in the top of the roads in the municipalities of Rychov , Guillermo žnou and Vertov .
in the area of the Eastern hemisphere , the sky will be on the back burner today , without rainfall .
temperatures will generally vary from three to zero and a positive measure will trigger a weak wind .
region of Pilate
the roads in the Pilate region are forged today morning , even though the precaution must be taken out , and it will be necessary to adapt to the time .
in the early hours of the morning there will be snow , temperatures will vary from three to nine degrees below zero .
after the snowfall and the subsequent decline in temperatures , some paths could also be filled with ice .
in some places , drivers will find themselves in fog , but visibility will gradually improve .
that is what the information centre for the region &apos;s roads has shown .
the D5 motorway is almost without restriction , although caution is also recommended , especially on the road between kilometre 80 and 131 .
the surface of most first @-@ category roads is dry and dry .
there may be sections with ice sheets in the area of Pilate and Tachov border with Germany .
the second and third categories are wetlands and so , in this case , it also warns of sections with ice sheets .
drivers should be more careful , especially on the least limited routes in the Lenuva area .
Middle East of Ologia
drivers who are directed to the highest areas in the Olomohes region will be partially caught up in snow .
after the chemical treatment , there was still snow in the port of Červenosské and on the road to Vidskskükford .
on the roads , road operators put off snow in the night ; on the road of Lenuper , some three centimetres of snow were accumulated , according to the managers of the routes .
in the rest of the region , the majority of avenues are adaptable without restrictions .
&quot; in the top areas of the road of Lenuper , there is rest of the snow .
the drivers in the port of Červenotské will be sitting on the middle of snow on the head of Christ &apos;s head , &quot; has today confirmed an operation of the road administration of Lenuper to ČTK .
on the ground and on the ground , they went to Jáická as well , and , after the chemical treatment , the avenues for the highest areas are now cleared and sealed .
on the road in Olomfying the routes are watertight without restrictions , in the road of a Frankenstein , drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections , where the routes are still wetlands .
region of the Ustí nad Suem and the region of Liberec region
road operators in northern Bohemia have been informed of complications in various sections at the first time of the morning .
apart from a few places in which the mountain road road transport between Tnice and Knnince in the Nanné region is closed , according to the police database .
temperatures are kept under zero , even in the lower areas , so ice and snow are obviously still on the brink , but in the lower areas , especially in the south @-@ east of the Czech miéte , there are no problems and the roads are usually dry .
there have been no complications of service in the way in which it has not been drawn up .
the road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Mr Špidla .
according to the weather weather , the conditions have been ideal during the night , while rain and snow are expected to plunge and night the sky will be clear and there will be ice .
from the general roads , unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I / 13 , on the border between the southern region of First Labour and Liberec .
the road between Tnice and Knnce had to be cut off from the branches of trees that had been archaeological on the ground with the weight of snow .
give a &apos; no &apos; : in our concerts , we want to accumulate positive energy .
it is said that in a little less than a month in the world , what is your view on this ?
it is just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to grasp .
the music group The TPA TPA likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to bring together enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it .
moreover , in December , you had a truly original project : three concerts against the end of the world .
can you explain to our readers ?
this is a state @-@ owned act that we have been planning for two years .
we decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the deadline by 21 December to 11 : 10 in the morning .
on the previous day , 20 December at 21 : 00 , we will organise three simultaneous concerts in Prague , Brno , and the day .
they will come roughly at the same time as the upper @-@ edge timetable is ending on the Island of the Island , in the Pacific Ocean , 12 hours ahead of our time zone .
who did this idea come from ?
initially , it was my idea , then we were forging the project together with our project designer Auylike .
in addition to wanting to pool sufficient positive energy and to avoid the end of the world , we also want to reflect , together with society , on the state in which we leave the world to our children .
on the occasion of the end of the upper timetable , we have also created a single collection of articles : guns , T @-@ shirts , stock exchanges , and original keys to the end of the world that can be bought at www.e @-@ plug - another way of supporting them .
the group The TPA , together with other interpreters , also sang the so @-@ called anthem against the end of the world , which has the title &quot; Fin in the world , cancelled . &quot;
today , he is very popular on YouTube , can he be heard at the charitable concerts ?
of course , and it will be right , it will be good , provided it is all well and not the world ...
all the interpreters will be sworn in at the same time in the three concerts .
the anthems will link between themselves thanks to the special TV broadcasting in the Czech television .
the letter of this song has been written to the song and interpreted the leading role of Jesus in life @-@ mouth , where he is also flying Xindl X ...
how did this collaboration emerge ?
we work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene , apart from organising many beneficial acts and concerts ...
we are very keen to take part in this project .
it has been proven that the majority of them are interested in working with us .
what will be spent on the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world ?
to equipment for the education centre without Frank barriers , which we have completed in its sixth year in a row with the civil partnership TPA in Jedličkassesststin .
the school pupils of Jedličkíov school regularly receive the visit of teachers with those who carry out mixed and interesting activities .
the pupils do not have enough financial means to pay the teachers and we do an eforce , or to make it possible .
in the context of the completion of the works on Jedličküov , there will be an independent building to which we will be moving with this project .
various groups and interpreters are active in each concert .
what are the selection criteria ?
we are trying to draw up a programme that is attractive to all generations , including children .
for example , in Prague , Suaski , Suifport Lesotho , the TPA TPA , Marán Buck and Jiří Suchford , the TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA , The TPA .
in order to obtain more detailed information , you can consult www.ktik.czcz.
do some other &quot; spectacular action &quot; be planned in the future ?
for the first time in May , we were to take action on the Prague festival in Prague , so we will certainly be preparing an attractive programme with interesting guests .
next year we would also like to touch on the post @-@ National Hall of New York and I personally , making it possible for us to take advantage of the fact that we are in the United States , would like to put it into action in Washington and Chicago .
your plans abroad are not exactly minimalists , so far you have acted in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
the TPA TPA is , however , a group of people with disabilities .
what is the logistics and the organisation of these journeys ?
it is not as difficult as it may seem at first sight .
there are five members in the power wheel , the chairs must travel in the baggage to luggage and we also have a great deal of weight , the boxes with the instruments ...
so far , however , we have managed to get it right .
even in Moscow , where we came back recently , everything was left without any problems .
thanks to foreign outlets , you can compare society &apos;s different attitudes towards the disabled and other aspects .
what have you found out so far ?
in Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities , everything works better than here ; we have seen in Russia that there is still a long way to go in the east .
unlike Prague , Moscow is full of barriers , and it is still not often that a person is to move alone to the city centre in a power wheel chair .
as usual as it is , for example , giving preference to someone in the wheelchair , there is not .
fortunately , a civil partnership has been created which strives to fear the problems of people with disabilities .
where should we take an example from the most developed countries ?
there are many aspects on which we are behind ...
it is important to mention , however , that improving and improving the situation always depends on the people who are directly affected .
in London and Madrid , it is quite normal for people with a serious disability to move around in public and to go to the service , to the museum , where it wants ...
but it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to be actively involved in social life , in this regard , by The TPA , we are going a little ahead !
a society respectful or without barriers is one thing , but when the time comes for eminent sportspeople , artists , actors , politicians or lawyers , it will start to change everything .
so far , they are isolated cases of people who have a great force of will .
the TPA TPA is currently very popular , but if we look back a few years ago , what did the group train in 1998 ?
I visited as a fan in Jedličkäov , where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something .
and since I am a fan , I am one of those who , among others , was founded by a partner group with a working partner .
and , over time , as our moderate Trichvivania says , we were in a bit of hands ( laughter ) .
but popularity did not reach the last few years - or I am mistaken ?
it is true that it helped us a great deal to connect with famous mullahs and also to work actively to promote the group .
we come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist .
thanks to the aid of the European Union , we can also allow ourselves to be teachers of quality , equipment and so on .
do you intend to go so far with The TAPA ?
from the very beginning , I saw the potential that had , which could be done in a different way .
the world of the spectacle is full of things that seem to be among the others .
it is logical , in its own way , that the whole thing is very much to be welcomed , and it takes a long time to accept it .
there are few extraordinary things , but I dare to say that The TPA is one of them .
the impression of someone who , for the first time , is clearly expressing compassion , is a natural reaction ...
but compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings and of whom we should have compassion .
there are people who are able to live a full life and develop , provided , of course , that they have the necessary means .
I always say that if something is done well for people with disabilities , then it is not only progress for them but for the whole of society .
did he help the fact that he is a demanding boss , as he is describing so many people ?
if we want to do a job of quality , we need to be rigorous in many respects and to demand some discipline .
I think it is completely normal .
some people come up with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they have heard that they have to go to the preparatory test for two days and spend a lot of time travelling and in concerts , the initial euphoria leaves them quickly .
but that is how it works everywhere , in every group that wants to work and achieve something .
at the moment , The TPA is 20 members .
how many of them were already in the beginning of 1998 ?
just one : cook to Angoania .
we are an open group , people enter and leave , they cannot be avoided .
anyone who is willing and willing will always find open doors
it will be the day before the expected end of the world , on Thursday 20 December 2012 at 9 p.m.
it will take place in the Prague Archfire in Prague , and in Pynoem in airport and will include 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic .
the three cities will be connected to the end of the evening through video video to sing the song of the &quot; Fin the world &quot; in the world , cancelled &quot;
the aim of the concert is to bring together the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without barriers in Jedličk.org in Prague , the cost of which is EUR 25 million .
the entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK , and children up to 12 years have no free entry into the option of early selling on head @-@ on @-@ site .
Poland and the pendulum .
the meeting of ministers from the countries of the European Space Agency last week was accepted to Poland as the twelfth member of the ESA . it is the second Member State in the ESA in Eastern Europe , after the Czech Republic , which became a full member on 12 November 2008 .
Poland started intensive cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years it participated in the agency of projects of the agency .
however , Poland &apos;s path to the predicament began much earlier .
Polish enthusiasts had already devoted to space before World War II , although their work was not always understood .
I would remind you , for example , of the conference of A. Špidla in the astronomical observatory in Warsaw , on which , on 6 December 1933 , he presented his ideas on the pioneering study &apos; Inring &apos; .
the ideas of the young engineer was left to the indifferent assistants , and years later I recalled that Dr Jan Gomski was the only person who had shown an interest in his work .
in France , the Sakharov Prize Robert Enraar @-@ Peltier and André Louis Hirsch for his &apos; Inring &apos; will be obtained in France in the year .
Dr Jan Gomski ( 1899 - 1966 ) , referred to earlier , became a great driver of astronauomy and grazing .
it produced hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline .
Holomski became a promoter promoter , known throughout the world , and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put on one of the dark side of the moon &apos;s hidden face .
as long ago as 1925 , a de facto plant was built in Poland which was to be supplied with a missile engine .
unfortunately , we do not know who the author of the proposal was , and they are not aware of the value of the project either .
it is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the grubbing @-@ up of the feed or for its brake .
the information on this dental is limited to the collection in the press of the time .
from the year 1933 , Polish artillery started to devote itself to the missiles .
the research was funded by the Komffíka Tangki Uzbry in collaboration with the canyyyyyyyyaiem , Gustawem Moi Moi .
on the basis of the retained material , it becomes clear that the investigation came to the stage of practical evidence .
however , with the arrival of German troops , the investigation was interrupted .
in the 1937 year in the specialist press , the prototype of a ballistic missile missile station designed by the engineer Rohoziz , and the following year , was published , and the &quot; Rakta &quot; study was published , the Meliwiztin Loetoboza , of the NLD , of the NLD .
both projects were intended for military use of missile engines .
shortly before the war , the interim scientific advisory committee ( Thmczrcza and Koudet Doradenena @-@ Nauowowand ) was responsible for all the missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all of the work .
the committee was founded in 1937 , but after two years of activity , it was interrupted by the beginning of the war .
other studies devoted to the genesis appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of astronomical ( Polske Towyritczczne ) .
in the November Treaty of 1954 , reference was made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronomical .
in one of them , on the basis of the report , it was proposed to create a society which would be devoted to the mountain .
it was already the case that artificial satellite projects had already been launched , and it was obvious that a kind of forward @-@ looking research was future discipline .
since the beginning of 1956 , the Polish Society of astronomical ( PTA ) sought to join the International Federation of astronomical ( founded in 1951 ) and the PTA became a full member in the autumn of that year .
the next year , the first president of the PTA , Kazakhstan , Ramasz ZanSusta ( 1902 - 1959 ) , became the Vice @-@ President of the International Federation of astronomical .
he had this office until his death in 1959 .
from 1956 , the PTA participated in a significant way in the development of the Rasta Measorolczna ) rocket rocket , which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which it carried out scientific research .
the first type RM @-@ 1 was finalised in 1957 and was launched for the first time on 10 October 1958 .
the rocket had an peak of 1 800 metres , about 80 metres in length and did not reach 5 kg of weight .
later , the RM @-@ 1A version was set to be built , and in the summer of 1959 the air tests for the two @-@ stage HM @-@ 2 rocket tests in the desert of Błęw .
the measured rocket was 1.4 metres , and it was around 11.5 kg .
another type of developing rocket was going to be the subject of real scientific study ; the RM @-@ 34 rocket would hold a peak of 1400km and its mission would be to control the wind up .
however , in 1962 , the work was suspended .
the successor to the first rockets of the RM type was the Meeor @-@ 1 rocket , which was built during the years 1962 and 1965 .
it was designed as a two @-@ step rocket , with a total length of 510 m and an initial weight of 32.5 kg .
three types ( called Meeor @-@ 1A - 11B and - 1 C ) - developed in each other by the space available for scientific equipment .
the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres in the Metternich @-@ 1A rocket , in the Metternich @-@ 1B of 0.34 litres , and in the Meeor @-@ 162 litres .
the maximum peak in the three rates was 37 km .
between the 1965 and 1968 years , it was developed at the Air Institute or the Meeor @-@ 2 rocket , whose first air tests started in October 1970 .
the Qeor @-@ 2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km high .
then the Meeor @-@ 2H and Meeor @-@ 3 version was built .
there is also a need to mention Poland &apos;s entry into the COSPR Research ( Comsupport for Energy Research ) in the 1960s and the formation of the national Committee of COSPR two years later .
in the Interinstitutional Programme , Poland joined the investigation of the language space for Soviet artificial satellites , and in the year 1978 , the Polish pilot , the Polish pilot , Taloszecski , became the second to be the second intermonmona after Mr Ragan has spoken out .
the suspension of the law on social work is not the solution .
last week , the constitutional trial suspended the social waste law .
the resolution aroused a heated debate in society .
it will certainly be interesting to examine the problems that exist from a broader point of view .
the liberal economic systems in the EU , as in the globalised world , are based on the principle of increased economic competition and less regulation .
this means , therefore , that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other .
the reason lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital , together with unbridled financial speculation .
the effect of large differences in labour costs ( from wages ) leads to economic tensions .
under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer , with the import of cheap goods , is trying to shorten distances and to do so &apos; leads to a drop @-@ out of the price of the competitor with a view to making the largest part of the market and thereby increasing its profit margins .
on a large scale , for the majority of employers , it means moving production abroad , buying the production abroad or disappear , and the result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour , compared with other economies , is higher .
because private capital does not have any social responsibility and therefore it is not responsible for unemployment , it is also necessarily increasing the state &apos;s social expenditure .
all of this situation leads to the total disregard of employers for paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage that they have caused in their quest for profit .
the situation is universally known to be that there is no need to submit specific statistical data .
the unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies , in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the people themselves and thereby attracting foreign capital into the country .
in other words , governments make private capital available to their own people without taking account of social decline .
this is particularly evident in the changes to the laws in force .
the aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital , particularly as regards wages .
this takes place on the one hand through the system of economic obligation in the event of long @-@ term unemployment ; on the other , through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights .
the result is growing poverty , together with the increase in differences between poor and poor .
for a number of years , there are , in Germany , food supplies for poor people who cannot continue with their own work .
the number of people receiving this type of aid now comes to a million .
in the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy , there is a fairly frequent case : people who are employed so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential for survival .
a scandal of this kind relates to the situation of the junior employees of the German federal parliament .
the savings measures of practically all the EU &apos;s southern states lead , without doubt , to the same situation : people , pressed for a deep @-@ blown decline of their social level , are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to squandering a poor wage on the limit of society , in the hope that it will one day come in the private investor country .
do we need to ask themselves where it comes from ?
if it is in other EU countries , then poverty goes from one country to another or never , since Chinese , Indians , Brazilians , Turks , Moroccans , Moroccans , Egyptians , Egyptians , and Africans are still working for a tiny part of a European wage .
this also affects the whole of Latin America .
liberal theories and the media argue so much that the state should not bring capital to the economy , and to lead the economy leads to failure .
private capital strongly defends the thesis that the state should not intervene in the meddling economy .
then we need to ask whether private capital does not influence its self @-@ interest in the political march and thus on the whole state .
in this case the answer is clearly yes .
the proof is the existence of lobbies , in the very powerful and ubiquitous practice in all states .
the result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption , in mutual favors , in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable .
in Germany , the situation is as follows : state ministries , in the absence of financial means , subject legal projects to private legal companies , which are often linked to industry .
these kinds of draft laws are subsequently approved in the Bundestag , the German Parliament .
in this way , all power does not come from the people , as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies , but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests .
it is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation will quickly find themselves in a situation how the crisis in the Roman republic in the days of Caesar &apos;s and Arcelor describes &quot; the state had been disintegrating and the administrations involved . &quot;
in return for bribes , favors obtained indiscriminately and help to finance stones or horror .
bribery and corruption spread without hindrance , and people are running to the ballot box in the run @-@ up vote &quot; ... &quot; there were no people in character to aspire to a post in the administration , so once , because of this disarray , the state was eight months &quot; ... &quot; he took seriously that the only cure for such a serious situation was autocracy , and that it was necessary to choose a strong man ... Although he was supposed to have stood up in Grundtvig . he rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy .
the conclusion , just as in ancient times , is that today &apos;s society is based on preferences that are not of individual benefit , without taking common interests into account .
private capital is not , in essence , capable of understanding and calling for the benefits of the whole of society .
the result is the same as that of then , the decline of the elite , without any effort being made to reform it in depth .
the causes of the boom of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be found in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the nineteenth and 20th centuries .
with respect for the current situation , it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracy , as a clear pause , waiting for the next blow .
the truly shocking fact is that the current elite completely ignore the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives , social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed , as well as crimes against humanity , as we know them in old and recent history .
the suspension of public procurement law is not the solution ; at least not in the long term .
under pressure of economic competition , both internationally and within the EU , the government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for other ways of reducing the social level of the population .
this trend is therefore systemic .
the solution is through concrete socio @-@ political reforms , which strengthen both the state &apos;s capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state .
Israel : the laboratory of chaos .
&quot; that feeling is from rape and notice &quot; ( there is no violence and nothing could do so ) , &#91; &quot; &#93; &quot; in his swan song , and whose refrain says &quot; Let &quot; don do not want us . &quot; ( let us not forget how fragile we are ) .
&quot; if my children did not want wars , there would be no &quot; Gutele Schneer , Mayer &apos;s wife , Amschel Roth , on his death bed in 1849 .
after the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip , various reactions have , as always , emerged .
one , on the side of Israel , argues in favor of the right of self @-@ defense and a role of terrorists in the role of terrorists , the other supports the Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the state of Israel , genocide against Palestinian Arabs , and describes Israel as a terrorist state .
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are regularly repeated and who are the victim , after all , today &apos;s citizens , including the autonomous territories , were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence .
my intention is to offer the readers a look behind the curtain , a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have lasted for 95 years ( calculated on the basis of the Bal4 statement in November 1917 ) on a small area of land in the Middle East .
some of my considerations are based on historical facts , others in conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter , on who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history .
in the history of humanity , the history of power struggles is in the front row .
every time , we can find a Alexander Magno or an Napoleon .
but it is no longer so obvious that it was always these people who led their steps in an autonomous way or if there was someone who led their actions to a certain objective .
we must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this entails , has not been able to reach a single generation .
among these astronomical families highlights one that could be regarded as the most prominent ( if there is still someone behind it , I do not know , but I do not understand it ) : the Amschild .
there is little talk to them .
of course .
in the 1990 &quot; s , they bought the first news agency to stop engaging their name with very serious criminal acts , power and wealth , or both , to cover them behind them , which for them always meant strengthening .
there are important shares in almost all the central banks in the world , and in those countries in which they are not represented , it has been declared or is preparing a war : before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries , after the Iraq attack were 5 , there were only four of them , but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government .
anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of the President of the Amschild , began during the War of Sreprinting money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre .
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the Federal reserve system ( EDF ) and was murdered in 1963 ; Mr Louis Patten Louis McMillan Fadden was poisoned in 1936 March by wanting to call on the EDF to trigger the major economic crisis of the year 1929 .
their quest for global power led them in the 1930 &quot; s - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars , which was designed by the Giar Albert Pike , in degree 33 .
the first war was aimed at eliminating the large monoonic states across Europe ; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy , especially from Great Britain , and the third intended to reduce the land population between half a million and a billion ( such an amount of slaves for their welfare and luxury would be enough and not to consume so many resources ) , as well as the creation of a universal religion ( the achievement is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution ) and the ultimate adoption of the absolute powers .
the method by which the group of richer families , together with the Amschild , operates , follows the dynamics of the outbreak of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution ( order from chaos ) .
however , these solutions are wrong , and they always lead to a worsening of the situation .
so , following the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro @-@ Hungarian , Francis , Francis , in Sarajevo , and after the beginning of this , the First World War was triggered by the beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution .
the First World War ended up suddenly and unjustified from a military and economic point of view , the capitulation of Germany ( wars to end @-@ Russia @-@ polar Russia ) and the subsequent break @-@ up of the great power of Central Europe , the Austro @-@ Hungarian empire .
in order to prepare the ground for the Second World War , they allowed bankers and politicians to set up , in a covert way , a conflict @-@ ridden situation as a result of the huge war repairs imposed on Germany , creating the optimum conditions for the radicalisation of the impoverished masses , and it was only strong and simple that a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities then formed and set up a strong German minority .
at the end of the nineteenth century , the Aschild promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement , a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state , preferably in the former Juja region with Jerusalem as capital ( return to the Sion ) .
the Balpage statement previously laid the foundations for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place .
terrorist attacks are being carried out on both sides .
World War II was World War II : it is difficult to know whether Hitler was too much on the ground that international bankers had on a principle or if everything he did was part of a plan . but the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the ideal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society .
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and , similarly to the way the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way to the Second World War , with the proclamation of the state of Israel set up for a third war .
if international bankers managed to launch it , the Jewish nation , as in the Second World War , would become the victim in the front line , now with the Arab population or , usually , Muslim in the Middle East .
Israel is an immense laboratory , a throw @-@ off machine and chaos , not only within its country , but also at international level , and let us take an example of how Israel &apos;s supporters and opponents are clearly divided up .
who is guilty , and who is the victim in the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict ? where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence , if at the start of everything was the greed of some individuals and their pursuit of world power ?
there is a need to distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders because , as in our country , international bankers are only presenting their candidates in the elections .
Israel &apos;s current president B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politics , loyal to international bankers , who makes every effort to declare war on Iran , and , given that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( China , Russia , Pakistan , Pakistan ... , it would threaten to become a global conflict , and if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz , where it gets 20 % of all world oil ( shipping corridor has just two miles away , it would lead to the destruction of the world economy .
under the light of what light is now shown on the words that David Ransdorf made in 1994 : &quot; the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order . &quot;
the new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves .
a world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well @-@ able financial bureaucracy .
a world in which every new individual is given a chip chip who controls all his or her own .
&quot; and requires everyone , small and large , rich and poor , free and slave to have a mark on the right hand or on the front , not to be able to buy or sell unless they have the name of this monster or the figures on their behalf .
it is necessary to understand : those who have two fingers at the front , who will add to the numbers of this monster .
the number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty @-@ six . &quot;
the Argo : if you get crude , call Hollywood
in November 1979 , a group of the demonstration of Islamist students held the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 of them as hostages .
his release was going to be in exchange for the deaconeced shah Mohamed Válevi , who after the revolution fled to the US , a country that had sponsored his regime for decades .
for the American administration , the situation did not offer any positive prospects : throwing the shhah on the ground could not be allowed , because if it did , it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries .
but the release of hostages in Iran , where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime , was not within its reach .
it was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free hostages by force .
the imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian Government .
in the US , its fate caused a wave of solidarity and anger against Iran .
failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to Jimmy Carter &apos;s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980 .
the film &quot; Argo &quot; of the director and actor Ben Afghanistan feared an episode in this history , which gained a little success for America .
shortly before occupying the embassy , six employees were left out of the building .
after a difficult run @-@ up , he ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy .
the Canadian authorities , in cooperation with the Canadian authorities , managed to get them out of Iran , thereby helped a story disguised as a bizarre point : they went on to Canadian passports , as members of the film equipment who looked at the location in the country for the establishment of a superstream of science fiction .
combination of the gender
the plan drawn up by the expert in the &quot; exotic &quot; Tizi Mellis required Hollywood &apos;s collaboration .
in order for the lie to appear to be true , the film project was written on specialist journals , press conferences organised , the production society has even had real office .
the details of the operation were kept secret for a long time , the film has been made from the memories of Tony Menam.
Afghanistan &apos;s film is a unique combination of a number of genders .
on the one hand , a realistic political mantra ; on the other , a so @-@ called &quot; catch @-@ up &quot; , the story of an episode that went well , a deception ( an example may be the series , &quot; s Eleve ) .
in the film , the state of mind is combined with a well @-@ documented sequences from Tehran : in the sequence of appropriations , there are headline photographs of the time of events , which were shaped in the same way in the film ; there are not many differences in this regard .
on the other hand , a rather more light , irony , and slight exaggeration in Hollywood .
furthermore , the scenes from the CIA and other institutions : committed men who analyse the situation at the negotiating table , in the corridors of the office , on the telephone ...
he has managed to restart his career in an excellent way .
the player , who had been misled , has become a respectable director , and his way of acting is no longer the target of ironic comments .
this is the third , then @-@ off , after the &apos; tiny cup &apos; , &apos; The Town &apos; , a city of thieves &apos; ( 2010 ) .
at the same time , it is the first passing film in which action does not take place in the city of Boston , where it was raised .
similarly , the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films beyond Hollywood &apos;s standards .
and Afghanistan has shown this in Argo , where Tehran is &quot; wheel &quot; in Canada .
the best scenes from the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of accurate events , and the introductory sequence of the embassy &apos;s taking place is impressive because of its capacity to provide us with the emotion of the confusion and lack of foresight that arises when history comes forward .
the cash @-@ off and its collaborators can have a similar effect on fictitious scenes ( the impersonal team in the bazaar of Tehran ) .
too many action in too many places .
the director had to accept the fact that a explained story does not offer much in the film sense of the most intriguing scenes .
he is quite right : he sometimes adds to the reality : there is nothing so elegant here - the scene of the crisis at Tehran airport , the diversion of a call to America , and the pursuit of unbridled pursuit of the crisis becomes madness .
Argo &apos;s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places .
Alan Arkin and John Pery play a very amusing role as Hollywood associates , even though their characters deserved more space and are not , let alone , the only one in this film .
for these reasons , Afghanistan &apos;s film is losing a bit of dramatic shock , but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest , assessing its realization and the re @-@ bearer of a thriler that evokes the 1970 &quot; s .
but collapse , that will be difficult .
as an indication of a real story , and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of the all @-@ embracing and ordinary @-@ science of the secret services can be , it is enough .
rules for the Fasside of Globalization , bananas and circus
the server at www.bankovnibob.com , who every year presents a survey on the most absurd banking charges , has now decided to announce the competition over &apos; the regulation or the most absurd ideas in the EU workshop &apos; .
&quot; we had happened after the latest event , the EU is planning to adopt a quota of 40 % in leading positions in major European companies , &quot; explained the organizing of the survey .
among the excuses nominated is , for example , the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women .
up to now , women have had better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a risk .
&quot; other incredible ideas of the EU workshop may be proposed by people by the end of this year . &quot;
the election will take place at the end of February 2013 , &quot; Mr Nacher reported .
among the EU &apos;s controversial regulations , for example , it is the compulsory addition of bio @-@ components to fuel which , as a result , damages the environment ; another ban is the use of the whole of life of mercury only because it contains a small amount of the dangerous substance and the size of the cages &apos; cages , which has contributed to the considerable increase in eggs this year .
a criticism has been made of the actual ban on the use of the phrase &apos; butter butter &apos; or the withdrawal of the classical light bulbs from the shops .
a high @-@ quality banana must have a length of 14 centimetres .
the Union &apos;s apparatus often takes such decisions under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby , whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states ( the Czech Republic , even with the threat of veto , claims the requirements of its banks ) .
the interests of a lobby were behind the request , for example , that higher @-@ quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimetres in the EU and could not produce &apos; abnormal treatment &apos; .
the European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonise national rules does not make it clear to date that they only made it more complicated for them to be placed on the market .
the rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU , despite opposition from some states , have been watered down on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of foodstuffs .
the candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the US last year , according to which it is compulsory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to raise them without the supervision of an adult .
the EU referred here to an American study according to which , when talking about toys , globalization is the main cause of child death .
a similar restriction applies to the use of child abuse by children of up to 14 years .
very curious people are born even in our country .
equally absurd is the regulation on European officials : anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia , so as not to upset Greece &apos;s sensitivity ( The Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
on the association of laissez @-@ faire economists in the survey , on the association of laissez @-@ faire economists , I was nominated by some of the absurd proposals mentioned above , the Union &apos;s prescription of the volume of food provisions in the territory of a Member State .
the EU found the maximum volumes of food provisions that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU .
then the Czech Republic exceeded , for example , the volume set to flourish , which was a threat of substantial fine .
the organisers of the survey also had an interest in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies .
this sort of idea did not emerge in Brussels but in Prague .
&quot; we are at a disadvantage because of not having a sea .
we call on the European Union to be compensated , &quot; declared in the autumn of 2004 the then Minister of Agriculture Jarhaühoas ( ČSSA ) .
he argued with the fact that there was a lot of grain in our country and , as a result of so @-@ called intervention purchases , the state had full stores and had to be exported .
according to it , given that the Czech Republic is far from the sea ports , the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros .
in the end , the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organised a public competition for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea .
the subsidy to receive a subsidy was proposed to the municipalities by the local development ministry led by Minister Pescu NDF ( US @-@ DU ) , in particular , it is intended to draw up applications for grants from Brussels .
EU : rare prescriptions are an exception
the Member States &apos; guidelines are often the target of criticism , the EU &apos;s efforts on regulations and , furthermore , more effective operation and development throughout the Union , according to various experts , deserve our recognition .
according to the experts , the most serious problem is , for example , the recovery of EU subsidies for projects which have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration , but which the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations .
the Czechs are also concerned with sensitive fibre , as well as in other countries of the Union , the fight for the right to the name of origin of their traditional products , even though our country has not always been victorious .
the Czechs , after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians , successfully defended the designation of origin of the re @-@ cited of Oloenenenenia , but they had to change their name to national rum , whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century , and it was called &quot; tuzememons . &quot;
only products produced from cane sugar cane can be so @-@ called rum , but not those made from sugar beet .
on the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU , together with the so @-@ called fat and gelongola around the world , the quagmire of the German city , the Swatry or Parma ham , is already found , for example , in the galleries of Karviy , the carhoford and Tford Scoreboard and , even , the variety of hops .
as a protected councillor of the EU , they will be able to be proud of the bread of jenenra of Parhesitation and the baronice baraiov Chakonošé .
people want the republic to save , but I am an amateur . he claims to do it .
Mr Senator , how did you stand for the elections for the chairman ?
it is not a question of being a senator or a president .
if in our country it was all right , then I would not be presenting my candidacy .
however , I can no longer bear in mind how the waste and the retirement age are being stolen in the past 20 years in our country .
he had no ambition to be political .
when I look at something I do not like , I try to find a solution for changing it .
since I already have 40 years and my candidacy is independent , the only possibility I have to change things is to stand as Senator or president .
the Senate has already arrived , but soon after it has put itself on the road to the presidency .
is it not turning away from those people who voted for it ?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections .
then , I know that if you were to elect a senator , I would be presenting my candidacy for the presidency .
but my aim is not the function ; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality .
that is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate .
the problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticise in the bar or in front of the television , but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate a change .
this is added to the media , which will discredit and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie .
it is said that I have paid journalists to journalists , or I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek .
let us talk about your ideas .
it presents itself with the presidential struggle with financial theory and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership above 20 million .
this must change the law .
as president , he does not have this competence , and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws .
how do you want to solve it ?
as a citizen , I have been part of a lobby to ensure that the guide trade is recognised as an autonomous work , and we managed to do so .
the problem lies in politics : if anyone arrives on a good proposal , whether on the right or on the left , it is rejected , and that affects citizens .
as an independent candidate , I have the greatest potential to gain the support of all the parliamentary groups .
without being able to call any party dogma or dogma , I have the capacity to choose something from each party that is best for our country and to implement it .
is it rather a right @-@ wing or left @-@ wing man ?
from the Czech point of view , I have the impression that I believe people are more left @-@ wing .
for me , it is not important , either a bit of the left or a bit of the right .
what matters to me is that we should move forward .
I do not care if anyone is on the right or on the left , I want to bring people together .
I also openly support any good solution , irrespective of whether the proposal comes from the KALM or the SDGs and , in the same way , I will be against bad ideas .
he makes a joke when he says he is populist .
but is he not demonstrating with what he says ?
when a business plan is created for the company , it also has certain objectives and ideals .
and you are moving on to them .
there will be those who call populism , but all the proposals that I am talking about already work in the world or the knowledge of them .
but , without the support of parliament , there are only slogans left left .
this cannot survive in long @-@ term policy .
or do you believe that if you go to people and speak to them , you will , for example , get a criminal and financial responsibility ?
I have no choice .
convince politicians , journalists and civil society and try to put them in place to achieve it .
if elected president , there would be no problem in organising a television broadcast on television in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimise criminal and financial liability for politicians , officials , judges and tax prosecutors .
they would perhaps have to inform us why they do not want it .
if a strong person points to disputes , pressure can be put on the political scene .
take the direct election of the president , which has been an achievement of public pressure .
at the same time I say that I am only an amateur , I am neither a genius nor an intellectual .
to my views and ideals , I try to look for allies .
I have just started in the policy and try to get the greatest possible support for my programme .
I will try to draw things forward myself , but if it does not go well , in six years &apos; time I will leave it and I will return to the private sector .
it sounds a little bit like the Czech Republic was going to save the Czech Republic .
I am not a bail @-@ out .
I know that with one person I am not doing anything , that is why I visited a number of well @-@ known personalities , if you were best to encourage you to submit your candidacy for the Senate .
I went to see Radim Janjaweed , but he refused because he had a lot of work to do .
for my own part , I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorvá , who brought into the light of the fraud with light oils of heating .
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied , now I am in the balance .
sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls and , those who did , voted for the establishment &apos;s representatives .
in the Senate , we are two of the independent sector .
people chose the Senate , so it will be difficult to make changes .
I will , however , defend my own ideas , such as the direct choice of mayors or governors .
is he considering forming his own party ?
I have not yet seen it because I do not have the time to do so , to check the past without any potential members of the party , nor do I have any money .
I do not have the money and I do not have a campaign for the presidency , in my transparent account there are only 20 000 kilogram .
does it not have money ?
it talks about statements of ownership , what is it ?
I think my private property is about 60 million .
in Prague I have an area valued in 25 million , a floor worth worth ten million , another floor at eight million , a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million , an Aba Martin of about 3.5 million and a Lenkoda super b valued in one million , and I have a couple of million in the light of this .
by the way , I have an Aba Martin because I was a dream of young people ; I was always pleased by James Bond , who led this car , was beautiful in front of women and , at the same time , was fighting against the evil and injustice .
does an Aba Martin lead , his property is valued at 60 million and does not have money for the campaign ?
he says that he wants to change the republic but does not want to put too much money on his side .
it is not very convincing .
I do not have 15 million for the campaign .
do I have to borrow me ?
I have already put 2.5 million to the campaign .
the fact that it does not have any sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my programme .
and I do not have the duty to pay for the campaign with money from my pocket .
the campaign costs essentially cover what I will receive in Senator &apos;s salary .
but I could not live with that , for example , I could not pay my son the English school , which costs 30 000 kilowatt months .
if I would just like to make money , then I would not be standing as a candidate .
is it that it will continue with its business so that it can live ?
did he not say that he was going to leave this business ?
this has nothing to do with higher pay .
as I have promised , I have partly left my activities .
for example , the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in the spring .
people would like the Samara to save the republic .
but I also need to live with something .
how often does he earn per month as an entrepreneur ?
between 200 000 and 400 000 , which I continue to win .
if he were president , then he would leave business .
you can consult the whole of the interview in Saturday &apos;s edition of the Berlin conference .
the MoVRDDDV architecture study shows that the real adventures are not only at their heads - in the example of the library of Spjkenuuin and the newly finished &quot; books mountain &quot; - 2 photos .
&quot; I believe that the building is fun , it has a glimpse side , and there is at last something interesting to see , &quot; says Livte Verhaizg , a transport on the streets .
and the IT technique in a large company located near the library points : &quot; the building is beautiful . &quot;
but I wonder why we need a library today .
we all have the Internet , bars and electronic books .
no one is happy to live in these old @-@ fashioned libraries , is it not ?
Lijkenomics , a corner city at the gates of Rotterdam , which deserves only a short visit , holds the dubious honour of having a record with a record to forget .
the population of 80 000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands .
to counter this disgraceful situation , a few years ago it was decided to contribute somewhat to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that are represented in the euro notes in the form of concrete mini @-@ soldiers .
the success of the educational offensive was limited .
this was the way that politicians decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics : a library had to be built !
&quot; the Dutch architecture study MVRDV , an entire master in the art of bars and responsible buildings , was taken up with his usual calm and appeared to be coming in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face .
and while the jury was confused around them and a shrinking of the shoulders , Maas had the size books set up by forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the following words : &quot; esteemed fellow citizens :
I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am proposing my proposal for the mountain of Sjkenitomics books , which is the so @-@ called &apos; Books &apos; .
nine years later , the mountain of EUR 30 million is on the ground .
this is part of the revitalisation project , which is complete with an underground park , a supermarket , a post office and a couple of house buildings .
at the beginning of November , the mountain of books was awarded to the second prize &apos; Best Litary of 2012 &apos; .
in addition , the project is also nominated by &apos; Dutch National Ward 2012 &apos; .
in this way , the small lack of history , which has so far had nothing more than to offer a post @-@ modern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly municipality after having a milk plant rather than a nuclear power station , now has a modern architecture work .
above all , however , the first public cultural building in its history is now in its history .
the Long Road to book
the first impression is that this is a book paradise under a cover @-@ up .
it is true to say that there is a lift that goes to the heart of this mountain of mountain , but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it , but rather prefer to merge with its topography every step of its escalation to the top .
the very thin air is bright and easy to cover in the light of the background , the soil of brick , and the elegant pagwaves unequivocally support the public condition of the library .
the urban environment is perfect .
when we look forward , it is possible to look at the banks of the park , dogs and children by playing football .
and on all sides books , books and more books .
&quot; normally the shelves of books are ready throughout the façade , and there is a huge dark room in the middle of the centre that usually is rather uncomfortable and unpersonal , &quot; says Winy Maas .
what we have done is to turn the classic shape of space into line and to get the internal reading area out of the outside .
the mountain is very well used : in the middle there are the offices , the Internet library , the chess club , the environmental education centre and the maintenance room .
it particularly deserves the black shelves that take on the dead @-@ eye functions , to stick to , and to crack down at the same time .
the light , tact , and smell are strange .
even the architects and civil engineers more the day shake their head when they hear of this unknown material .
&quot; we wanted to work with recycled materials , &quot; the project &apos;s chief chief is to be explained to us in the city of Myjkenita .
and that is how , one day , in an agricultural exploitation of Yugoslavia , we are faced with the right by @-@ product from agriculture .
for many years , in the Canary Islands and in the Netherlands , a plastic tissue is used as a basis for subjecting the roots of the crops .
it is cheap and efficient .
this fine tissue has two stations and then goes off the ground .
for the library , this fabric was put forward , for the first time in such quantities , to getting packaging of four centimetres on the ground .
with heat and pressure , the so @-@ called agricultural plastic ( KLP ) is changing its colour and becomes a dark , homogenous and resilient material that smacks of a mixture of a new car and sport .
after 105 damage comes to the top of the mountain .
at the end of this ongoing road of almost 500 metres around the mountain , the reward awaits us : from the coffee shop not only is it a fantastic sight of the city , it can also enjoy a few taste of a village , and its people are planted in huge planets .
they create a pleasant atmosphere at the same time as they keep the right air for this mountain of literature .
gifts for a New soul
&quot; even though it is hard to believe this in the light of its vast areas , this building is an exemplary model for ecology . &quot;
the necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy .
despite the fact that the mountains of books are placed under a huge glass pyramid , even in the darkest days of the sun , the sun is conspicuous only for a few hours at home .
the huge landslides of timber that are cross @-@ cutting to the window dressing serve to give the shadow and absorb the majority of the sun &apos;s rays .
this creates a comfortable internal climate .
the rest is a matter of automatic leave .
the skeptical worker in the information technology sector has already dared to stand up in the new library .
and Livte Verhaig has also been there .
similarly , China &apos;s traditional doctor in medicine has visited the library , describing him as the &quot; late soul &quot; of Sjkenisin .
the reason is that , following the inauguration of a couple of weeks ago , all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private stock .
in this way , we intend to fill the optimal gaps in a library , which still does not have its full file ; today , it is now 70 000 copies .
the concept has been profound .
the shelves are full .
&quot; there is nothing worse than a half @-@ empty library , &quot; says the architect Rivero .
&quot; I believe that , thanks to our initiative , all the people now have a certain link with this building .
you all know that your book is part of the library .
even though it is only to be there for it .
in this way , the MVRDV study has achieved a great deal of success in this discipline , which is known as &quot; the creation of an identity &quot; in the specialised arts .
the city of Spjkenitemi has written a piece in the history of literature .
regardless of the young and inculcating it can be .
finally , a starting point for shaping their identity .
Sabo : &quot; Germans must play a more central role &quot;
Germany has abstained on the vote on the admission of Palestine .
according to Stephen Szent , an expert in US relations , this puts Berlin in a rather difficult diplomatic position .
in the beginning of the week , Mr Welle , Germany gave the opinion that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of a UN observer state .
finally , however , Berlin abstained .
why ?
Mr Szent , Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
but because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel , Germany must be careful .
at the same time , however , I do not think that he supports the American position .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel .
during the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011 , Germany also abstained when it was a matter of establishing a flight ban zone .
this has finally been declared by NATO .
is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake ?
yes , it is .
this is due to the fact that its foreign policy is now being redirected , moving away from a policy that was led , so to speak , by the United States and focused on a German foreign policy .
what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy .
the Germans are therefore at a crossroads .
they are expected to play a more independent role , but they are not accustomed to doing so .
I believe they are still showing what their role will be , but they have already started the road to a &quot; normal &quot; foreign policy .
a foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain .
what does &quot; normal &quot; foreign policy specifically mean from the German point of view ?
it is a policy which , when it comes to national interests , is ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners .
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy , in other words , in exports and in its relations with certain regions , such as Russia , China or the Middle East .
German economic interests are to some extent different to those of other great powers , and that is why Germany must protect its interests .
did economic interests have an influence on the stance taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the UN vote ?
on the one hand , Germany has large markets in the Middle East , especially in the Gulf .
that is why it must be careful and not alienated from Arab public opinion or from the Arab elites .
this is important , of course .
but it would not be so important to me because it is not a totally unilateral relationship .
they do , however , play a fundamental role in German considerations .
has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions as in the vote on Palestine ?
I believe that in Europe , and even in the United States , the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding .
for this reason , I do not believe that there has been such a dramatic break as in the case of Libya .
perhaps Germany has succeeded in gaining a certain respect .
after all , all of this has only made it clear that it is a country that is serious as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account .
there are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe .
instead , the US has clearly shown itself to be in favour of a veto .
is there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations ?
there have always been such disparities due to internal American policy .
I think that the Obama administration is in secret with a great deal of understanding of the European position .
however , because of the political situation here , it is clear that the government cannot defend this position in public .
I believe that the real disparity of opinions does not actually have the extent to which it is attributed .
if we look at relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu , we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy that he develops .
is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it has with Israel and the United States , on the one hand , with the position of its main partners in the EU , on the other ?
I think that this is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans .
of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy , but that is not the case .
they therefore do not have the opportunity to be part of a higher body , but must promote things from their own position .
that is precisely what the euro is now doing .
I believe that in the future , Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance .
of course , this is not easy for Germany , either , simply because of the relationship it has with Israel .
this has always been a difficult issue .
but I believe that the Germans clearly have to play the role of an independent figure .
does Germany see itself as an important international player , and does Germany really want to play a leading role ?
or is it still difficult for him to accept that leadership ?
Germany has not grown accustomed , it is always something uncomfortable and , for obvious reasons , the country is still struggling to play a greater role .
if we look at the euro crisis , for example , every time Germany positioning itself as a major player , certain anti @-@ German sentiments are unleashed .
this is not easy for the Germans .
this is an old problem , and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries .
seen in this way , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US .
it must be responsive to the different neighbours and opinions , and that is not easy .
the influence of the US on European policy is diminishing ever more , but the EU does not , at the moment , cover that gap , who is then ?
the Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role .
even if they do not like it , if it is unpleasant for them , or if they make them an even more unpopular people , c &apos; est the rest !
Mr Lewis is the Executive Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington , an institution in which academics and experts in politics from Europe and North America jointly analyse the challenges facing the transatlantic community .

&quot; protection of brands &quot; in China : when Puma and Ari suddenly become Chinese brands .
Armani is a known brand worldwide and Polo is also known as a global brand .
but what is Armani Polo ?
after this name , there is an officially registered designation in China , but it has nothing to do with the original companies .
however , the protection is protected while the real platitudes do not present a demand .
even then , it is not clear that they are being told .
&quot; to foreigners , it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China , &quot; he points out Thomas Patloch , a lawyer for the law Taylor Wessing specialist in violation of protection rights in the Far East .
every week , a new case comes to my table .
the imitation will simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their brands .
in this way , Gci becomes Lu @-@ Gci and instead of Proade is recorded on the Move .
German companies are also legally copying in the same way , as has occurred to the manufacturer of sports goods .
Stucch is opening up a stadium on the seat of the Beijing brand office .
on 14 September 2010 , a Chinese company had to register the Zegna Left Pma , an artificial name that was also used for the fashionable house , Erm, Zegna .
that the Chinese are global champions of copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known .
in large cities , there are large stores of various plants devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting .
however , the cases of Milošević are of a different nature , and on the basis of their customers , he has fought against the fact that the brand office officially gives Chinese companies the right to benefit from a designation that is already registered elsewhere .
the Chinese called it &quot; Bg Ming PAI &quot; or an accompanying brand .
the word comes from the Chinese term &apos; Bg Dakuan &apos; .
I refer to women who have &apos; fish &apos; a rich man .
the Chinese authorities don &apos;t feel guilty
&quot; it is harmful to business , it has to be fought , &quot; it requires Patloch .
&quot; the brand does water , the monopoly position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous . &quot;
the financial losses and the procedural coasts of the sectors affected are millions , especially in the case of luxury flagship products .
according to data from the CSA market analysis company , with a volume of EUR 15 billion a year , China is , in size , the third luxury goods market and is growing at a higher pace .
however , the cancellation of clauses of dubious legality in the registration register is complicated and also a lot of money .
the processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain .
the headlines talk of cases in which the court dismissed a demand because it took so long that the name subject to demand had already become a &quot; market reality . &quot;
&quot; if the complainant is bad , perhaps he may even have to pay money to the fister because the process has damaged the Chinese mark , &quot; he points out .
this is sometimes the law of the jungle .
some of the most well @-@ known cases have to do with graphic elements .
in 2009 , Dailer @-@ Benz lost a case against the construction machinery manufacturer , the company that has recently been absorbed by the German of the concrete bombs in Putin .
that is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the star of Mercedes .
the buyer of Volvo , Geely , used the principle as a white and blue logo , which was very much reminiscent of BMW ; the matter was settled in the courts and Geely and had to be amended .
the DDorda manufacturer in China was lost from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original .
the Chinese authorities do not feel guilty .
the CTBT office in Beijing recognises that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing .
last year , however , &quot; the situation of work emergency returned to normality . &quot;
in this way , the number of pre @-@ complaints processes has fallen by 22 % .
almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved , 75 % more than the year before .
however , 8500 complaints are still pending .
combating this cost a great deal of money
as is often the case in China , the numbers are striking .
last year , the CTBT recorded over 1.4 million product protection applications , almost one @-@ third more than in 2010 .
it will be a new record , and it means that China heads the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth year in a row , according to the brand office .
this also seems to be the case with the number of scientists who are valid , amounting to 5.5 million in total .
in 2011 , EUR 1.8 billion would have been poured into rights .
in other words , this means that on average each registration costs EUR 1.280 , or EUR 160 .
fighting this cost a lot of money , as is shown by the German family company Freudenberg .
for more than seven years , the group has argued in court against a Chinese imitation .
while the Germans have managed to halt the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts ,
the imitation has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand .
&quot; we have caused this situation ourselves because in Germany , the names are not protected , &quot; sets out Hanno Wentzler , President , and deputy Secretariat of Freudenberg Chonolists in Munich .
the SO office also dismissed the use of the municipalities .
in the next two places you have given the reason to Freudenberg , but the opposite part is still fighting at the moment .
we have to be extremely careful .
now the case has arrived at the doors of the High Court of Justice , where there is still room for resolution .
he is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue in a positive manner and praises the professionalism of the courts .
however , it also says that &apos; the procedure is extremely costly , both in terms of money and in time &apos; .
it is difficult to estimate the internal costs ; the business file has had to review files of up to 100 years old to be able to provide evidence .
five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite part to a &apos; sum of six figures in euros &apos; with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement , but it was not successful .
&quot; this shows how much we care about &quot; , he points out .
the dangers facing the Far East even threaten Europe ,
in particular , there are rights of non @-@ protected brand rights there .
thus , a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products .
the group had been abandoning this commercial area for a long time , but it succeeded in preventing registration .
&quot; you need to be very careful , &quot; says Wentzler .
both he and the lawyers lawyer recommend that German companies be extremely prudent in doing business with China .
it is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights , but that what we have to do is to &quot; also record what may be susceptible to protection &quot; in China , as Wentzler points out .
otherwise , the issue can be much more expensive than a simple register .
in fact , in the event of Freudenberg losing the latest assault on his particular battle , he would then have to pay the opposite part of licence on his own behalf , as Wentzler explains .
this or the segment in question would expel us from the market .
world in the fight against AIDS : dance , sing , help
in Roelberg is the chorus of the chorus Tax , and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans is happy .
the story of a link capable of overcoming much more than 8 733 kilometres .
first of all , we start with the dance : bouhods , carpons , hair @-@ grabbing shoes and spins trying to go back on the ground , and they find it quickly .
two , three , four .
only then will the voices of the mullahs ( a low , low , light , and host ) rise slowly , drag on , hampered , and continue to go on to others .
and the director of 29 years , the director of 29 , threatens to go beyond his box by trying to put his own house in order with his strong and soft gestures .
on Monday evening , in the music room , the chorus of a new song is the chorus of a new song , which was the chorus of a new song .
the 1950s , between 23 and 69 , have also arrived from the human gene to the master &apos;s master .
&apos;Om &apos; Oani is not an easy piece , every voice of the chorus has a different text and in a foreign language that is scarcely known : the zulo , a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa , Botswana , Malawi , Malawi , Mozambique , and in some areas of Swaziland .
support for self @-@ help
according to an estimate of UNAIDS , the United Nations programme for the fight against AIDS , there are approximately 34 million people in the world who have been infected with the HIV virus .
twenty @-@ three million of them live in southern Africa .
in Swaziland there are 245 000 AIDS orphans .
more than 40 % of the population is already HIV @-@ positive .
the British People &apos;s Association for Africa has found in Germany fathers for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esiji .
seventy of them attend secondary school .
for 15 or EUR 20 a month , a child can be counted .
this contribution will cover school enrollment , the uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day in the Bavarian Center .
the Sbonoooooooés means at the zulo &quot; story of stories &quot; or &quot; pan @-@ globalists . &quot;
there is no one in this room in this Chamber who can speak with a clean @-@ up language , but he does know .
for ten years , I have had this chorus in this mild foreign language which has sometimes succeeded in transporting them to their place of origin : southern Africa .
by 8 733 kilometres of off @-@ line distance from Roelberg , in the north @-@ east of the kingdom of Swaziland , there is a people called Esitji who is dependent on the voices of this German chorus .
forty percent are infected
around 2 000 people live there , some of them are still simply a bit of mud and straw , and a large proportion of them are children .
more than 300 are no longer parents because they have succumbed to AIDS .
Ssiji is a small example of what is affecting Swaziland : the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest hopes of living throughout the world , according to UNICEF .
people do not look favourably on circumcision - a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion .
more than 40 % of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immune virus , and dying a little over thirty years has become customary .
during a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 , the chorus discovered this strong population , but what they saw , above all , were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents , but also the main thing : food , clothing , and training .
without school , the possibilities in a poor country are more than few .
initially it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go out to school and enjoyed a hot meal a day , for a few euros .
one year later , however , the chorus founded the &quot; Voice for Africa &quot; partnership that has since been occupied professionally for AIDS orphans in Esijji .
facts on sexual transmission infections
what are the main diseases of sexual transmission ?
between the ETS of bacterial origin , there is the sysyois , the cry for freedom , and the very high @-@ level area .
the most commonly rich ETS of origin is AIDS , the human child , genital mutilation , or hepatitis .
quiet and Sarna are among the ETS transmitted by parasites .
what are the main groups concerned ?
spilis and the agorine are more often in men who have sexual relations with other men .
the Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of every five cases of sysysyas in Germany have their origins in sexual contact between men .
in the case of heterosexual adults , the most commonly known diseases of sexual transmission are the infections that have been made to speak of a human child , to the candidate ( honour ) and to the high @-@ level disease .
the infection of HIV among the country &apos;s heterosexual adults is relatively low ; however , approximately 20 % of new HIV infections are recorded in this group .
among young people , male @-@ minded infections are far more normal than in other population groups .
according to surveys of Europe , three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 @-@ 25 .
in our country , the disease virus is also added to the most normal diseases among young people .
how has the number of infections developed ?
not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration .
according to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of robots has doubled its figure of 1 697 cases in 2001 to 3 698 cases in 2011 .
the number of new HIV infections has a downward trend since 2007 .
in 2011 , approximately 2 700 cases were recorded .
this is a tenth part less than in the previous year .
what symptoms indicate that this is a deadly disease ?
infectious diseases can cause hooligans in the genital area , inconvenience to the orinar , flow , pain pain , as well as amthtear or verdergas .
they often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and are therefore not detected .
how can we be protected ?
condoms can reduce the risk of contagion , but they do not offer 100 % protection .
some pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through illness and physical contact .
for this reason , the experts recommend that medical examinations be regularly subjected to medical examinations , particularly if they are often changed by sexual partners .
if you are diagnosed early , the majority of the ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequence .
through partnerships , donations and , last but not least , on the fees paid by the chorus for their actions throughout Germany , they come up with quite a lot of money .
&quot; in total , we have already sent some EUR 200 000 to Esiji , &quot; he points out proud Ante Lennarz , the president of the partnership .
in the people of Zodwa Damini , a self @-@ confident woman , with leadership in office , manages the money sent out from Germany .
it is important for orphans to find good accommodation , for example with one of the floodgates .
the &quot; galists , &quot; as older women at zulu are called , are the pillars of the people .
some of them have up to 14 orphans in office , they offer a ceiling in which they live and deal with children coming to school every day in time and dressed in their uniforms .
those who do not have anyone to be left under the protection of Mursia , a lone woman who , as well as the two cook to cook every day for more than 200 starving children , receives a wage from the partnership .
in addition , the &quot; Voice of Africa &quot; has launched a cost school , has built two houses and , in collaboration with the US health organisation the PSI , has achieved that many of the people &apos;s inhabitants have been subjected to an HIV test .
this is not obvious , since , despite the fact that this disease is widely known throughout the country , it does not usually speak openly about it .
a King with 14 wives
&quot; AIDS is an absolute taboo , &quot; he asserts , &quot; he has to do with sexuality &quot; .
that is strange in a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
the last absolute monarch of Black Africa , King Mskti III , is known for his affluent lifestyle and full of excesses .
rather , it is not a matter of democracy .
this non @-@ accepted way of life is largely responsible for the very rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades .
but it is also because of the countless temporary people who travel by the country on one side and the other and leave them where they go .
according to Ante Lennz , &quot; in any corner , free condoms can be achieved , but they are hardly used .
it is another culture , here it only accepts skin contact . &quot;
to promote cultural exchange , the chorus operator travels every two or three years in south of Africa singing songs that speak of gloom , combative spirit , hope , and confidence in the black race that many in the most southern end of the African continent still recall the era of apartheid .
a bus full of whites who sing songs in a language of black ; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a great deal of joy , but has also managed to jump a couple of tears to some of them another border soldier .
the journey always leads to Esitji , where the mullahs visit the unborn children .
despite the fact that this small population is hardly appearing on the maps , in the River Ezulwi River Valley it is well known .
&quot; the light is the light , &quot; says the people of the place there .
and after carrying 8 733 kilometres on the straight line back to Goberg to the trial rooms on the street in the street , it is clear that it is also possible to see its light in the past .
have a warning to be the case : the NASA Test in Mercure
the Massger wave has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercure .
the ice layer is likely to have an abundance of up to 20 metres .
NASA , the American space agency , has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercure .
despite the fact that the planet is closer to the sun , there is also ice water there , as has been reported from three studies published on Thursday in the specialised magazine &quot; Science &apos; .
he would have found evidence in the area of the planet which is permanently in the shadow of an ice sheet .
it seems that the latter has at least 30 centimetres and probably even 20 metres from the ground .
the water should presumably be made available to us , or , with great probability , to the asteroid which at the time came up against Mercure .
no one is associated with the finding of ice with the possibility of life on the planet . it says the researcher head of the Mésger , Seen Solon .
the temperature in Mercure can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius .
however , the findings could help to clarify how water and other components of life have come to other areas of the solar system .
it is completely ignored for the inhabitants of the planet Earth , the sounds , telchels , and small robots such as the Phoenix are going to explore the depths of the universe .
from time to time they send images to the earth : small windows to the immense space of space .
the picture comes from a chamber developed by German researchers from the Max Plaesk Institute .
the eight planets that make up our solar system , as well as the planet dwarf Ces .
just as Pagion , which revolves around the sun just behind Nepalese one , according to the new definition of the term published by the international astronomical Union in 2006 , it is not a &quot; planet . &quot;
this section of an underused image taken by the teltutttzer telzer shows a &quot; image of the family &quot; in which there are infinite generations of stars : the oldest stars are shown to be blue spots , although the most difficult to recognize is the rose colour of the &quot; newly born &quot; stars .
this star @-@ forming region , called a little romantic by the scientists W5 , was discovered by the telschtzer telzer in the constellation of Copopa , a distance of 3.6 years light .

the Maryites , a group of stars also known as the &quot; Gte Heri &quot; is a visible focus on the sky .
however , there is a better understanding of colours in the TV directory .
there is a huge red eye , and it appears that this is an enormous red light .
it is placed in the light of 700 years of the constellation of fish .
his similarity to a land continent has earned him the deep @-@ seated North American .
the combination of a normal photograph and an image of the offender gives rise to a spectacular colourful .
this looming star could be caught in all its glory for the first time by the misdetecers of the teluttzer telzer .
he and his cronies : how they were born is still one of the great stories of astronauomy .
this is probably a waste of one of the lolans that disappeared without trace a 4.5 billion years ago .
one of the greatest and most clear photographs taken by the Hubbble , the Galacamia on the ink .
depending on fools , some images of backbone are becoming real works of art .
the image published by the Southern European Monitoring Centre shows the grey area of several thousands of light years in the constellation of Sagitent .
the named Latin American name comes from the term &quot; three @-@ fold &quot; ( divided into three ) , as dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this area of training in three lóthels .
in the constellation of Ofiuco , the Iisomos were able to discern the signs of a mamlical kind : 400 million of the world &apos;s light of the earth , the hubs of two galaxies in fusion are thrown off one to the other to end up in an irreversible way .
this star formation was taken over by the Hurium nebum in the Mashia spiral of 83 .
those of us who do not want to do so can refer to it with the very high turnout .

the grey area of 1.4 000 light years is made up of particles of dust , the size of which is 10 @-@ hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find at home .
this image was created on the basis of optical images and radiological images made by different viewers .
it shows a ring of black holes in the form of 430 million years of the earth .
this panel , called Arp 273 , served for a time of model for NASA &apos;s web space .
the scientists call the largest size UGC 1810 .
in this grey area , there is the most brilliant youth star group of our Via Baltica .
this very beautiful area of training is constantly coming up with new stars .
in this star cloud , associated with the murky Roseta , new star , too , is continually coming up ; 5 years from the earth .
there is no dust at all in this brilliant black hole in this small black hole , only gas .
researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang , when in the universe , in particular , hydrogen could be found .
our window to the universe : the most important spotlight .
it seems that the telchopo was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 , before Galileo was used to use it one year later to watch the stars .
since then , the lights on the use of spirits have not stopped growing , and the images they offer have ever greater depth .
for 30 years , in particular from 1947 to 1975 , the spotlight on the Observatory near St DiI was the largest in the world .
your mirror , in the image , had a clear five @-@ metre metre .
in Arizona , the US is lifted , and the Large Bolle Tushing is lifted .
it makes it possible to observe the compass through two mirrors , each with a clear metre of 8.4 metres .
the interior of the Great Canary Islands located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a succinct metre of 10.4 metres .
the mirror of the Southern South Africa , on the first hand , in South Africa , has been driven to save costs .
in spite of this , it reaches a clear metre of approximately 11 metres .
the inconvenience of this most economic construction is that the spotlight has a angle of steady rise , so its mobility is limited .
the chuco @-@ Eberby TV telary also has an angle of rise fixed .
its counterpart is its enormous capacity to take light .
despite a relatively smaller mirror metre , such capacity is comparable to that of the world &apos;s largest headlines .
with the help of the Aods radio ( Puerto Rico ) , researchers can explore the universe in search of out @-@ of @-@ land life signals .

I am thinking of the Southern European Monitoring Centre ( ESO ) in the Chilean Andes .
here is the Very Lge Tain , a chat tank that does honor to its name .
with a total of four mirrors , such a web can also see the shadow of non @-@ existent .
the ESO will also welcome the so @-@ called E @-@ ELT ( European Stely Large Tchoose , which is an extremely high @-@ ranking European strategy . )
their primary mirror will cover 42 metres , and it will be composed of a total of 1 000 pre @-@ empting elements .
2018 is not expected to be able to take images .
until 2007 , the two polls in the volcano in Maa KEA were regarded as the largest in the world .
they have two mirrors , each with an inch of 10 metres .
the TV viewers are part of the Observatory Maa KEA , who , together with them , looks at the sky with the help of the TV station , and the IRTF .
in Maa KEA , a new queue is planned for enormous proportions and with a sound , 30 @-@ metre mirror .
this is an image of how it would be .
however , the most important information of the cosmos reaches us from the Hurium space of space .
since 24 April 1990 , it sends out images of distant worlds .
since March 2009 , the Dpher space station is looking for extra @-@ solar pilgrims , mainly those that are inaccessible .
on 2 February 2011 , NASA announced that 1.235 candidates were located since the beginning of its mission .

the TV professor James Web Tspace Tom ( JWT ) will not be launched into space on board Solvency 5 to 2018 .
the primary mirror of this space TV station is on an 6.5 metre metre .
one of the functions of this chat @-@ book will be to look for the light of the first stars and galleries formed after the big bang .
researchers take the basis that in the southern pole of Mercure there is also ice .
there is no proof , however , that the Mésanger is around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north .
for decades , the radar measurements have led to the existence of ice in Mercure .
thanks to the Medsanger ( 2004 ) , the first hanging around Mercure , the scientists now have the certainty that this is the case .

the hill and mountain region could be described as savage and romantic .
the mini @-@ bus is making a great deal of progress through the road to road that goes hand in hand with wild hills , large @-@ scale rivers and the simple homes of local farmers .
it is all the green and play , one might even think that it is on the Black Selva .
however , we are in the most southern areas of Azerbaijan ; the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away from here .
here we live in the &apos; alyalhi &apos; people , a people who do not know a great deal , apart from the fact that they fully dominate the Arctic and the Azeri , which are very much to be encouraged .
our final destination is Lurk .
this small city boasts of a perhaps far too loose architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit fully into the so @-@ called mountainous landscape .
European tourists hardly reach this place , as the road from Azerbaijan &apos;s capital is too heavy .
to go through the 323 kilometres that both cities separate , it takes eight hours because the road is one @-@ way .
the amazing wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the region .
it is , however , convinced that the Pilate Fatah is convinced that Litk has what is needed to become a tourist attraction .
&quot; Baku was famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Wall , and next year we will celebrate the summer of the world &apos;s elderly people , &quot; he points out , Fatah points to it .
this is the head of the longevity Museum , perhaps the only one that exists in the world .
it is right that the life of eight dozens of talyshos who have exceeded 100 years of age should be documented , and that he is pointing out a black @-@ and @-@ white image .
this is my grandfather , who lived for 120 years .
his son died at the age of 136
the undisputed star of the museum , however , is the herd of sheep in the midst of Ashirali Lesslüov , who seems to have lived in 168 years .
there is , however , no starting ground to be certified .
and if we bear in mind that the older man experienced 122 years , it seems that the age of Riyadh is quite suspicious .
&quot; it was born in the region in 1805 , and died in 1973 , &quot; he explained to him .
he was married on three occasions and had 23 children , apparently he still had time to conceive of an daughter more than the age of 136 .
is it wrong then , in a couple of decades , that they are wrong in a couple of decades , in a few decades &quot; time ?
however , Rleusvt Scholz , the geronlogist Institute at the Max Feck Institute of Rozk , has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia .
&quot; in some regions of China , Japan , or in Pakistan &apos;s Valley of Hungary also live people of very advanced age , &quot; says Scholz , &quot; even in Sardinia , there are many elderly men . &quot;
due to the lack of documentation , it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age , especially when there is no civilian register either .
all the days filled with butter full of butter
it is a fact that , surprisingly , the inhabitants of the region on the camp around Lessk often reach a biblical age .
at present , there are 20 people over 100 years of age .
why are so many elderly people living here in the south ?
the Assyrian tourism guide , Farid Muimzadh , explains that this is the special genes of the shyshens .
the museum &apos;s director , Mrs Merkies , believes that the cause lies in food .
however , from a nutritional point of view , it does not seem reasonable to say that it is precisely the fuel @-@ rich diet of alyyhi , who love meat , bread and above all dairy products and many of whom , furthermore , drink a glass of derredine on a daily basis , is so healthy .
or may it be the way of life that keeps young people out ? in Cenememan , a small settlement not far from the town of Litk live Rubara Dizayeva .
it is relatively young for her 97 years to be seen as being taken over by these Latin Americans .
Stzayeva , who claims to have 143 descendants , lives on a simple house of timber typical of the entire Caucasus region .
sitting on the ground , it has moved a great deal of butter on the ground .
eight people live under a ceiling , including one of the children , and a Tzayeva daughter , both of them became grandparents a long time ago .
they also shine on one side to another two small children .
in the kitchen , I prepare for the guests , a tea who serves on typical boats in a way that was acquitted .
the teeth of Mirzayeva are white and perfectly aligned , and under the headscarf it conceals two dark dark flies that your son discovers proud .
I have always made my hair off with milk , so I have never got away with it and maintained its colour .
&quot; I have not ever used a Varu , &quot; he says the Mirzeva .
the pension is enough to live
they have always eaten only what they produced on their own farm : tomatoes , potatoes and headscarves .
in my entire life , I have never gone to buy a supermarket .
then we are talking about his husband , who was in the army .
the worst was the post @-@ World War II era .
however , everything went back to the point when the &apos; dear father &apos; , Heyden Aliyev , took control of the situation .
this type of propaganda sounds rare for a larger woman .
in Azerbaijan , however , the cult of a nation &apos;s paternalistic figure , which runs his country as a dictator , knows no bounds .
he remained in power until 2003 , when he gave the witness to his son Iham .
at least the elderly people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is .
Dzayeva is in charge of 230 posts ( about the same amount in euros ) in a monthly pension scheme , a sum in which he can live well by taking account of the situation here .
and perhaps the dear Dizayeva son is right : &quot; in our culture the elderly are very respected . &quot;
they live in a great family , they are loved , they receive all the necessary care and they are happy .
as if this were not enough to be sustained for many years ...
the Constitution lacks the expression &apos; Human Rights &apos;
the revolution has returned to Cairo .
protests that rival each other in Cairo show the tremendous division into which the country is mired .
the future constitution , with Sharia as a basis , is very controversial .
Egypt &apos;s president did not spare his teeth .
&quot; we must overcome the transition .
and that is my responsibility , to the people and to God , &apos; he said on public television .
your speech was directed at the whole people , particularly the Coptic Christians , the Liberals , enlightened Muslims and the secular .
all of them , unremedied so far in confusing opposition , are afraid .
fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile , for the grace of the powerful Muslim community .
as Mohammed Mursi explains whether , almost to apologise , he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his &quot; to save the revolution . &quot;
however , neither Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what the 61 @-@ year @-@ old engineer with a doctoral title given by the University of South California really wants to save .
does he intend to deprive the judiciary of his power ?
indeed , the 234 articles , whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15 @-@ hour night meeting , are truly worrying .
as in former constitutions , the draft also states that the case @-@ law is based on the &quot; principles of Islamic law . &quot;
what does this mean , however , of &apos; principles &apos; ?
this was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation , as well as the scope for legal manoeuvre that has been carried out , in order to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia law .
this is at least what a new article suggests : in all law @-@ related issues it is compulsory to consult Al @-@ Ashar University , the country &apos;s most important Islamic institution with great power in all of Sunni Islamism .
it does not have to be the case , but this may mean that the clergy would monitor the legislation , which - in fact , would result in the impossibility of the judiciary .
much of the constitution &apos;s draft constitution is open to interpretation
what is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction .
during the Mubarak dictatorship , these courts served to exercise harsh repression of the opposition .
following the dictator &apos;s demise to 11 000 civilians were arrested in military prisons .
as set out in the draft , the state must protect &quot; the true essence of the Egyptian family &quot; and &quot; promote their morals and their values . &quot;
this is such a vague formulation in legal terms that , with the help of this article , state institutions could even control the content of cinema and literature .
to be clear , this is not something other than censorship .
incidentally , no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women .
on the other hand , there is no other banning of offending or slander the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies .
however , it is not clear what an offence is and how it is to be punished .
equally dubious is the wording that prohibits &quot; offending people &quot;
is a caricature of the president or a joke about a sign ?
it is a question of interpretation , like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Murif it is to be signed and that his words &apos; very soon &apos; will be presented to the Egyptians to be put to a referendum .
&quot; the Revolution has returned &quot;
weeks ago , the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists .
ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square of the Cary , and was sworn in to make the Minutes fail before it can enter into force .
&quot; the revolution has returned , and we will end up &apos; , says Hamdin Saberi , who ranks third on the lists to the presidential elections .
the Nobel Peace Prize and the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed El @-@ Baradei , declared that the draft constitution should be &quot; in the dustbin of history . &quot;
through Twitter he accused the supporters of Murif he wanted to lead a &quot; state coup against democracy . &quot;
&quot; when you call the referendum we will go on to your palace and let us put it back , &quot; says the opponent to be Said .
&quot; we are not yet tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been filled , &quot; was cited in the Egyptian media to the opposition politician Chaled Ali .
and several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum , so it would not be regarded as valid .
&quot; the Koran is our constitution &quot;
for its part , the well @-@ organised Muslim community called for a counter @-@ station ; not in Tahrir Square , but after a sentence on the other side of the Nile , at the University of Cairo .
many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry : &apos; people require the application of divine law &apos; .
he called for Murif &quot; clean up the country , &quot; at the same time as he proclaimed : &quot; the Koran is our constitution . &quot;
a struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square , where everything began , would have caused a similar situation to the civil war .
it is clear that Murder &apos;s supporters did not want to risk that something like this happened .
the Muslim brothers claimed that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters of the constitution would have expressed its opinions loud and clear .
now it is time to leave the people to decide what direction the country should take .
in this respect , it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed by a majority .
&quot; the expression &quot; Human Rights &quot; is not even appearing . &quot;
the Abu Sata is furious with this forced constitutional process that it really should have lasted until February and have included all the social forces .
this 48 @-@ year lawyer in human rights and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization ( EOHR ) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face trial during Mubarak &apos;s dictatorship .
not because he shared his ideology , but because he is indivisible for him .
it was for this reason that he was beaten , condemned and imprisoned .
&quot; and now the expression &apos; Human Rights &apos; does not even appear in the new constitution &apos; , it is regretted in a conversation with the newspaper &apos; Wt will &apos; .
extending the competence of Murif the three powers of the state caused this lawyer to resign .
the measures taken are blatant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship .
&quot; instead of strengthening civil society , what the president has done is to abolish it , &quot; he regrets the President of the European Parliament .
however , democracy cannot work without civil society organisations .
he is abandoned , including by the international community , which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile and with a mixture of curiosity and tension .
this could turn against him .
a demonstration in Tahrir Square warns : &quot; you have a monster that you cannot control . &quot;
the Norwegian Vicsk : is the world &apos;s most unhealthy fish ?
the five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not only of Europe but of the world .
is it possible that the country &apos;s success would be related to its greed for a very poor fish ?
I would like to take a number of things which are far too easy to deal with .
put them in the midst of a dirty and wet mountain of football .
let us look back on a week .
then we can see the paralysing of the aksk , which is one of Norway &apos;s foot @-@ and @-@ mouth .
I find myself in the small city of Fagnines at three hours in Oslo .
the landscape is spectacular and that smell , always present , of the fleet in the air .
the akfisk is triling in water over water for , depending on the evil that you prefer , up to one year .
as it obscures and is turning out to be cold , the Norwegians go on to a festival that is being held here in Fagines , devoted to this so @-@ called charm , so to speak .
&quot; you eat crude , and then drink a glass of fire from a traitor , &quot; says Havard Halsen , a city brigade that is also what is known as the &quot; General of Raksk &quot; , which is responsible for organising the festival .
on all sides , we are seeing people eating this fish which is being kept in small rooms and drinking a huge amount of drink .
&quot; some people like it more like the athlete than the Weafsk , &quot; says Havard .
the drink can kill the smell .
let us make sure that this is done .
if you can avoid taking it close to your nose , it is not wrong ; it is not very different from a fraction of people who have travelled a few kilometres on bus .
it is a product which comes from a very different time , in which poverty struck Norway and where , before there was cooling , fish were held during the autumn of water and salt in closed barrels .
later on , in the middle of winter , when it is already well placed , it is removed and , obviously , with the idle senses due to alcohol , it is eaten .
only a generation ago , thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work , and migrated mainly to the US .
currently , the population is rising rapidly ; more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by the abundance of jobs , high wages and a complete system of social services .
a population of Sweden , the old rival , and even far too much richer than Norway , comes to this country to work .
it is regarded as something important , but an essential but rather bad part of Norway &apos;s past .
it is among the most expensive plates that can be bought .
but , in fact , everything is expensive , as a beer cane , or a bunch of people , cost the sun of 10 € 10 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway is not often on the agenda of international news and the majority of the Norwegians like it to .
here , people are still unwilling to speak the name of Anders Breivik , the extreme right @-@ wing racist who has soared and murdered 77 people , including men , women and children .
instead , they refer to the shooting as &quot; the event of 22 July . &quot;
it is hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own is capable of committing such cruelty and murder .
following much of Norway &apos;s current wealth is growth , from the beginning of the 1970 &quot; s , from one of the world &apos;s largest oil and gas industries .
&quot; but oil is not the only reason why we are so good , &quot; says Anna , our shrimp was , while he is going away from aksk , and that , with his long @-@ standing meloly and his surprising blue eyes , he represents the image of Norwegian welfare .
&quot; we are , as you say , prudent people . &quot;
his English , like that of the majority of people in this country , is impeccable .
&quot; we don &apos;t like to boast , we don &apos;t like hold @-@ up . &quot;
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully ; everything , except a small percentage of money from this industry , is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
while the world was wasting money that it did not have in the years before the financial crisis around the world , Norway maintained the well @-@ closed purse .
&quot; as long as we can escape in winter and go down in the summer , we are happy , &quot; says Anna .
&quot; and , &quot; lunch , adds to a slippery slope .
I am in the snow running to eat something ; I have had enough of it .
now there is no doubt that it is quite a different matter and quite a bit of a taste of life .
at night , however , it is returning to the wild fish .
the hotel in which I am at an eye is one of the many local people in which a dinner dinner was celebrated in which people are voting for the best fish , or perhaps the one that puts the mass graves in the test .
a television has directly connected with a winner who has paid lip service and who is surrounded by hooligans .
it seems to be the contest for Eurovision .
&quot; what are your comments for the best fish in the mountains , Thor @-@ Juergen ? &quot;
&quot; here is our score , Havard . &quot;
there is laughter and applause .
a man goes off from the chair , perhaps he will get out of the newspaper .
or perhaps it is the fish of the whole fish .
Mexico : Enrique Peña Nieto is facing a hard start .
as long as Mexico &apos;s incoming President , Enrique Peña Nieto , is preparing to take office , the BBC correspondent , Will Grant , looks at the challenges that the new president and the different expectations of his people will face .
the trafficking in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
in a city which , in the best of circumstances , is already in itself , a siege of steel has been installed since Monday , short of the main roads that lead to the city and which is causing huge chaos on the roads .
the aim , however , was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work , but to prevent the demonstrators from coming to parliament .
on Saturday , Mexico &apos;s new president , Enrique Peña Nieto , will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation .
it faces a difficult task .
Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón , but the country is plunged into a war against the drug @-@ drug that has claimed about 60 000 lives in six years .
&quot; my government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence , &quot; Mr Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States , Barack Obama , in the Oval Office .
&quot; I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal . &quot;
before the US president , he was the governor of his home country , that of Mexico .
a very populous state with rapid growth , which surrounds the capital ; opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move .
a Good Man
in the bulily city of Valle de Valley , for example , he is reminded of affection .
its residents attribute its merit to the growth of tourism in the place and to the construction of infrastructures .
to reach the city can be led by one of Mr Peña Nieto &apos;s new roads , which is a huge improvement compared to the rough and bumpy roads that have been rebuilt .
they can also be seen with their name in the entrance to a modern polalist and an impressive interactive museum on climate change .
&quot; we trust that he will succeed in making a real and lasting change , &quot; he says his friend and political ally Gabriel Gabriel , a member of Mr Peña Nieto &apos;s party , the PRI .
&quot; particularly , as far as security and economics are concerned , we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country needs . &quot;
after an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power , the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000 .
the honourable Member admits that , after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Angeles , there are many expectations within the party about Enrique Peña Nieto .
it also rejects the rating that the opposition makes of the new president &apos;s essence .
&quot; he is a very honest , very committed man and an excellent vision of the country .
he is a fantastic man of state and , above all , he is a person who knows to listen . &quot;
however , on the other side of the state , it is not the impression that many people have on their former governor .
in Nestlé , also known as Nel City , the contrast with the hot spots of the Bringo Valley could not be higher .
hiding behind high motorway stretches is , in many ways , a sub @-@ geostrategic in Mexico &apos;s own City .
and the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban .
at the beginning of this year , military intervention was called for to help the fight against the drug gangs operating in districts and violence against women is particularly serious .
in a desert area , located in conjunction with a waste landfill , the bodies of dozens of women murdered have been abandoned in the last couple of years .
more than 1 000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Peña Nieto was the governor , a much higher rate than that of the City of Culture , unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murdering innocent women .
Mr Peña Nieto &apos;s critics say , at best , that he failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in office .
the most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye .
in a concrete house , typical of the impoverished neighborhood , Iran has to make efforts to contain the tears as it shows photographs of its deceased daughter , Mariana moon .
according to the official version of events , Mariana committed suicide in 2010 .
his family , however , believes that his partner was murdered .
&quot; when I arrived at their home , he seemed as if he had cleaned up the body , &quot; he recalls Mrs Buserved .
&quot; there were signs that it had been hit , and the rigour has already appeared . &quot;
as long as his mother brings the story back to history , a photograph of Marana observes on the walls , along with a cross in which one word is read : justice .
however , that is exactly what the family says it has been denied .
&quot; the state authorities have dealt with me as if it were an old trap , a chucer , a complaining .
what they want is that they simply accept what they say and do &quot; .
&quot; but that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence , &quot; he says .
the presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by enormous responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years , and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office .
&quot; I hope that it will be the same kind of president as Governor , &quot; says the member of the PRI Oladin Valley .
however , that is precisely what the families of the victims of the City of Culture are most afraid of .
Oley Manard did not condemn ill @-@ treatment , according to the prosecutors claim ,
the prosecutors are trying to deal with complaints of the Gay Law Manning for his stay in prison .
the trial focuses on the Manning period in the military prison prison in Virginia .
defence wants the case to be dismissed on the grounds that the imprisonment of Manning was severe .
the army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents .
the prosecutors tried to show on Friday that the Front soldier Manning , accused of the greatest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States , lost a great deal of opportunity to denounce the ill @-@ treatment he now claims he suffered while being under military arrest .
during the interrogation by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office to Manade in the run @-@ up to the FTT trial , Maryland , Maryland , the prosecutor Ashden Isin said that the records of the weekly visits by the unit the unit that Manard received for nine months of arrest in Quantico , Virginia , have no condemnation of how he was treated .
the interrogation , which was carried out during a hearing carried out as a result of the request for the defence of the fact that its incarceration had been harsh and which had already meant enough punishment , came a day after Manard had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was arrested .
the army &apos;s analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents as long as he was in Iraq .
later , WikiLeaks published Internet material .
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information .
in the light of Friday , Fin reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers closed after visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison prison in Quantico , where he was imprisoned in the highest detention regime since July 2010 to April 2011 .
the officers would have put questions to Manning and noted his answers .
when , on Friday , he asked about the forms , Manard recognized that he had described the treatment that the plumbers had as &quot; excellent &quot; and the treatment received in the facilities in general as &quot; very professional . &quot;
the forms do not show any denunciation of ill @-@ treatment , even though the officers asked Manning directly on the treatment he was receiving , he claimed .
he replied that he had expressed concern about a number of issues and that the officers he visited were talking about these problems and had indicated that they would be treated but that they did not take note of these issues in the register .
&quot; it wrote &quot; without any occurrences &quot; ( after talking about the problems ) but this does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problems , &quot; he said Manning .
the judge , Colonel of the Army Denia Lind , also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council to examine the suicide intentions that he had expressed in a months earlier .
he replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the &quot; injury prevention &quot; regime under which he was in .
the military said that they had put it under that restrictive regime , which is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide , to guarantee its protection and the safety of other people .
&quot; I wanted the state to know that I was right , and ( wanted ) to stop being under injury prevention - in my view , it is a better quality of life , &quot; he said Manning .
his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held in Iraq for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison base in Quantico , Virginia , in July 2010 , was held by the trial .
he said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that he once lost knowledge due to the heat .
he said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him in the outside world was very distressing .
&quot; my world was reduced to the cage , to the cage , &quot; explained to the cage on Thursday .
&quot; I thought I was going to die in this cage . &quot;
Oning said that , once moved to Quantio , he was in a small cell of days , at least for 21 hours , and often for 23 hours , without company .
he said that he was only allowed to have a cushion , a manta , a chadcin , something of clothes , and his glasses .
he said that he was trying to move the whole time , as he was forbidden to sleep or even go bankrupt during the day .
Manning said that he had a light of light at all times while pointing out to his eyes while he was sleeping .
he said that if the kidnappers were unable to see their face when they went back at night , they would wake up to them again so that they could turn back .
the Manning lawyer presented a formal complaint about the treatment he was receiving in January 2011 .
Manning was transferred to the military prison of a Fortress Leity in Kansas in April 2011 .
on Friday , the judge asked for Manning about a plea he had made in the statement on Thursday , according to which , having forced a night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantio , he was forced to count on a good news line to remain a toothless count in front of the tellers and other prisoners .
he had argued that he had never been given the opportunity to cover up the count during the count .
during the judge of the judge on Friday , Manning said that he would pass through the order that he gave to him that he had to leave the stick with which he could have covered himself , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to fall .
he testified on Thursday that he had forced him to sleep over the past night as a result of an attempt to show an official that he was not a danger to himself .
he claimed that he had told the official that he could have used the elastic of his domestic clothes , or his or her masters to lose them but did not .
he testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell his internal clothes , his chesatize and their glasses .
his lawyers hope that the judge will at least take account of the experiences that he spent during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his judgment if he was condemned on the war council , which is scheduled to start at the beginning of next year .
the defence stated that he intends to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and defend other charges that were too extreme .
this is expected to resume this weekend , and the prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions for detention were justified .
the Pentagon has argued that Manning was held in accordance with the implementing rules that are at the highest custody in Quantico .
charges against Manar include cooperation with the enemy , illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet , leak of information on national defense and theft of ownership or public registers .
if he is guilty of all charges , he could face life imprisonment .
my Mexican @-@ American identity Crisis
he says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities .
Mexicans tend to criticize those that were ; they say that they remind the Mexicans of those difficult times .
Moscow is saying that the Mexican @-@ American people are caught between two worlds .
in a recent trip to Mexico City , it was scarcely reduced by the extrtron and reaching the immigration @-@ processing area and was completely confused .
the cartels indicated the way to two queues : one for &quot; the &quot; Mexons &quot; and the other to &quot; foreigners . &quot;
I was left there a few seconds without being sure where I should go .
having grown in Central California , throughout my life , I have been called &quot; Mexican . &quot;
it is an ethnic shell , just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as &apos; Irish &apos; or my friends in New York describe themselves as &apos; Italians &apos; .
then I went to &apos; Mexican @-@ American &apos; .
but that was Mexico .
and , in the homeland of my grandfather , carcgraphy or parons were not necessary .
it was simply an American one .
I am going to be good enough to handle me during an interview in this language .
I do not , however , have the level of vocabulary of a native and I cannot disregard my American emphasis .
so I took my American passport and I put myself in the queue of foreigners .
I thought at the time this week that Mexico &apos;s elected president , Enrique Peña Nieto , visited the White House to meet President Obama .
on the agenda of the day , as always the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
Peña Nieto was willing to talk about the Mexican economy &apos;s growth as well , one of the reasons why Mexico is so likely to remain in Mexico like the US to go to the US .
it wants to associate with the United States and Canada and to create a European Union @-@ style trade block in North America .
moreover , Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico , although he did not give details .
for Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness .
most Americans probably never agree that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half their territory at the barrel of a gun .
but for Mexicans , who think in centuries , not in minutes , the elements that are reminded of them are everywhere .
so , at the time when a US official says anything that leads to the slightest criticism of Mexico , he remains hesitant to hear complaints , both in the press and between the Mexican elite , about how Americans are stifling the sovereignty of their neighbors .
and the children of the children of Mucma are put on the foot of war .
and yet , for Mexico , the relationship that really poses a challenge is that of the more than 35 million Mexican @-@ American living in the United States .
do we talk about bitterness ?
there is a lot .
in Mexico there are winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not .
the only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles , The Vaga , Phoenix , Denver or San Antonio is that , at some point in our native tree , there was one person , the father or the mother or one of the grandparents , who was shut off from the opportunities in Mexico and had to move towards the north .
and most of the time , the person fitted into a particular profile : dark fur , a low level of studies from a poor people and so on .
we are their top @-@ down , and we are loyal to them .
Mexico does not .
and even though we may now be living up to the American dream , having gone to good schools and had good work , we must never lose sight of what we are experiencing , the American dream , not the Mexican dream .
it may be that our identity is sometimes unclear , but our loyalty does .
it is for the United States .
moreover , we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite elite do not like it .
the sentiment is mutual .
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and are watching us on top of the shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough .
our Spanish will never be good enough and our links with Mexico will never be strong enough .
in their view , our existence is synonymous with failure .
if our families had not failed in Mexico , they would not have gone .
and now we would not be caught up in the wake of this Silk Curtain , living well in the United States but , even so , as isolated souls .
my wife , who was born in Guchampions and came legally to the United States when he was a girl , reminds me that there is such a mess between Mexicans and the Mexican @-@ Americans because the former know what they are and what they are being annoyed about .
although it is a citizen of the United States , it is considered to be part of the two countries .
meanwhile , many Mexican @-@ American people feel that they are not part of either of them .
we love to hear the Mexican Tigers , but also the Mexican Tigers .
you are the best of every country , but you are not rooted in any of them .
in Mexico , they see us as Americans .
in the United States , we are regarded as Mexicans .
now , in order to complicate matters further , from what I have learned during my trip , some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to go back to the diaspora .
they want the Mexican @-@ Americans to work as &quot; ambassadors &quot; of makeshift Mexico , representing their interests in the United States .
we would say to our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and push political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico .
yes , of course ...
that is not going to happen .
there is too much bitterness .
and , with wage inequality , rampant corruption and violence by drugs , many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country .
I am afraid that you are going to remain on our own with this idea , my friends .
it is fair .
if some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican @-@ American people still suffer by the way their relatives were treated a great deal less time .
the road to this is not the case .
perhaps we are more &apos; Mexicans &apos; than I thought .
the New Middle East
the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a unlikely basis for peace .
can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ?
another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain .
in the midst of the useless and regular discussions on who began first , lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most civilians , and six Israelis have been murdered , and for the first time missiles have fallen near Tel Aviv , Israel &apos;s metropolis , and the holy city of Jerusalem .
but , despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict , all surrounding them in the Middle East is changing .
the Arab Spring has made everything , whether they like it or not , Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional turmoil .
perhaps this will make their fight even more bloody than before .
there are , however , reason to think that its lethal deadlock may be kept silent .
a War that won &apos;t and won &apos;t be won
at first glance , optimism now seems very difficult to justify .
even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained , this week &apos;s clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides .
the leaders of Hamas , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw , even though Gaza has been beaten up .
and despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most miserable corners of the planet , Israel has not been able to end Hamas .
indeed , Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank , the other part of Palestine currently governed by its ruthless rivals of Fatah , the most moderate Palestinian faction .
moreover , Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing in their favor .
given that Islamists have been gaining influence across the Arab world , Hamas has made rich and powerful friends .
Turkey , a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel , has embraced the cause of Hamas , as Qatar , one of the richest and dynamic Gulf states .
Hamas members of Hamas say that the Islamist moon is surrounded by Israel , from Lebanon to the north , where Hezbollah &apos;s party @-@ militia are dominated by Syria , where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could topple Bashar Assad , to Jordan , where Hamas allies are threatening the king .
above all on Israel &apos;s southern flank , the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt , with the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries , has changed the balance of the region .
Hosni Mubarak , the secular despot that ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011 , did not have enough time for Hamas .
by contrast , the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas brothers and their leaders are more dependent on popular opinion .
in future diplomatic actions , it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a player that cannot be excluded , not even Israel and the United States .
meanwhile , the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion .
as far as the military issue is concerned , they have put Hamas in their place .
the anti @-@ missile system in Israel has proved its worth and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed .
the Israelis will look more calm - for some time .
as for diplomacy , the US is stronger than ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the last wave of violence .
first of all , Israel has succeeded , especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended up with the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has not had too many suicide bombers , partly thanks to the barrier to the West Bank , the main component of an aspiring territory to become Palestine , and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to rise despite the fact that , according to international law , they are illegal .
Mr Netanyahu , whose Likud party has joined a group of an even more tough line led by Ahanyqerman in the run @-@ up to the elections on 22 January , is in a good position .
why do these mistakes be brought to light by the Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ?
if he were really to govern in the West Bank , would he not trigger rockets as his compatriots in Gaza have done ?
it is better to have them after that wall and to give them a good blow to their heads .
perhaps the hard wing will be imposed , although the Arab spring could alter its calculations .
even though the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have enough respect for Israel , their priority will be to address domestic difficulties .
Israel &apos;s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together .
holding a war with the superpower in the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies .
that the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something .
the Israelis , too , should think long @-@ term .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depriving the Palestinians of their right to self @-@ determination is creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel , just as this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv .
repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demography is making the situation worse as the Arab population grows .
the cross @-@ border missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever @-@ increasing diplomatic toll .
both sides need a boost from people outside the conflict .
the solution is still that which advocates sensible people on both sides , the majority of the outside world and this newspaper : two states and Israel &apos;s surrender of territory for security reasons .
the short @-@ term hope is that the cease will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause .
Egypt , which must begin to curb arms inflows in Gaza , together with Turkey and Qatar , is in an unprecedented situation to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders , with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem .
Arabs outside the business should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join .
this would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to get a category of virtual state in the UN .
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table .
during his first term , he failed to present his own peace plan .
again in the White House , it seems just as reluctant to devote your attention to it .
this attitude is a deplorable vision of the future .
a stable Middle East is of vital interest to the US .
this means a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine .
the generic package of tobacco packaging enters into force in Australia .
warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with disease are hanging over the heat of a green colour , which is the same for all tobacco marks .
the Australian tobacco and packaging law , a pioneer in the world , enters into force and replaced logists and colours of trademarks on a packaging of an olive @-@ green storm , horrific images of body parts with diseases and representations of sick children and babies to be children of smokers .
apart from the different images and health warnings , the only difference between the aircraft compulsory since Saturday is the names of trademarks , all of them printed in a type of small source .
it is the strictest regime in the world applied to packaging .
the federal government of Australia claims that the aim is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit hold our own .
they rely on studies which show that if a person has not started smoking before 26 years , there is 99 % the possibility that he never does that .
&quot; you can see that children , even from very early age , understand the message that the company tobacco is trying to sell through its brand , &quot; the federal health minister , Tya Pliberk , said , by quoting studies that showed , for example , how girls related the logo to a krona with the idea of being a crown .
although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much , other countries are considering similar measures .
the tobacco industry has exerted huge pressure against the law .
tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market in tobacco , in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible .
&quot; the legislation would have serious unintended consequences , &quot; said Scott McInre , of British American Tobacco , in Australia .
it will increase the amount of tobacco which will result in counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia .
other people say that their business has benefited following the adoption of the law .
Marra has , from Zico @-@ have been subsidised Ptd , a small family company , claimed that the demand for silicone and silicone cover to plug the unpleasant images of the canons had soared almost from scratch two months ago , when British American Tobacco , Leon &apos;s imperial , Philip Morris , and Japan Tobacco lost the law in Australia &apos;s Supreme Court .
she stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was waiting for more stocks .
&quot; for us it is a good business . &quot;
according to the experts , the potential obstacle is the popularity of the social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed .
after a number of Australian laws that ban advertising on television and the sponsorship of sport and force the majority of sellers to not put cigarettes in sight , the marketing of tobacco has become online .
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local companies and websites , but cannot restrict it to foreign pages .
&quot; if you trade in tobacco and only have this small window to promote your products , the online space is the most convincing place in which it is , &quot; he said Becky Freeman , public health research at the University of Sydney .
Huntington noted an increase in returns on brands from the &quot; street citizens &quot; published on the web pages of social networks such as YouTube , Twitter , and Facebook .
one wonders whether this is just a private citizen to whom I would like to love cigarettes , Marlrenen , and they have taken the trouble to make a video or whether some marketing company is behind it .
the British American Tobacco in Australia indicated that the industry is more focused on what the new regulation implies than on marketing .
industry has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to apply the new rules ; these countries are saying to the World Trade Organisation that trade is being restricted unfairly , even though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia .
the WTO is likely to dictate a resolution in mid @-@ 2013 .
the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws on packaging packaging , that the government had held discussions with other countries .
in 2001 , Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images on the front lines .
they are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries , including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India are considering tougher laws .
in Australia , many smokers are challenging .
&quot; photographs do not affect me .
I simply do not do it . &apos;
&quot; you take the cigarette off and keep the package , &quot; says Victor El , while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth .
&quot; frankly , there is only one reason why I would stop smoking : my daughter . &quot;
James Yu , managing the King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney , suggests that the uniforms are making it more difficult for them to put them on the shelves .
&quot; normally it took an hour to advance a surrender ; now I will be four , &quot; Yu claims .
&quot; the government should have banned tobacco completely , and then it is worth it , it ends up and close the shop , &quot; he says as he draws up his hands upwards .
in a constantly connected world , a little bit so badly .
during the day of speech of thanks to this year , I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane we went on to have had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to come .
so I had a very great deal of time to think about the mud .
I am not going to lie .
half a day at an airport waiting for a flight , it is rather boring , even if it has the means to be kept , such as books , magazines or IPPons , not forgetting the duty @-@ free shops .
but more and more scholars and child @-@ development experts are praising the bonies of the mud .
according to them , it is good that , both we and our children , we are tired of time and again .
it is the brain to look for interesting choices , and it may encourage creativity .
since , at present , most of us are connected to this or that screen , we do not experience the benefits associated with it .
so , should we take a good look at it ?
yes .
not .
however , we will discuss it later on .
first of all , like many people , it assumed that , now that we have more time for leisure , it would be a relatively recent phenomenon .
but , as Peter Tohey , a professor of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calamy , says , in Canada , and author of the book &quot; Borire : to Liry and History &quot; in 2011 by Yale University University , this is not the case .
&quot; in fact , the story of the boring is very extensive , &quot; he says .
in the walls of Arcelor , there are now in Latin in place in Latin on the torance dating back to the first century .
we must also consider how we define it .
&quot; the problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a very variety of ways , &quot; suggests John D. Eastwood , a professor at the University of York in 11 , Canada .
after examining the inquiries published and put forward the idea before a discussion group of 100 people , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the tarnished experience of &quot; wanting but not power , participate in an activity that is full . &quot;
he says that the difference between hanged and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do so .
it says that there is no desire to do something with apathy .
the main experience of the boring , he says , is &quot; the disruption of the attention process , associated with a low state of mind , and a sense that time is slow . &quot;
it may sound terribly akin to depression .
Professor Eastwood , however , says that , although they may be related , people who are boring tend to see the problem as an issue of the environment or of the world , while people who are depressed consider the problem to be the problem .
sometimes we believe that we are boring , when what we are actually doing is that we have problems concentrating .
in his study &quot; The Unenaged Mind : Deending Borading Borentio &quot; , published in the September edition of the outlook is on Pdycholtic Science , Professor Eastwood , and his colleagues sent to a previous experiment in which the participants heard a documentary from a person who read the article of a magazine .
some groups listened to a television programme in the Chamber with a television programme which had no relationship , others listened to it with the low volume , so it was hardly visible , while the third group did not listen to us at any time .
the group that listened to the program with the volume under way showed more care than the other two groups ; it was hard for them to concentrate , but they were not sure why and they attributed it to the mud .
&quot; when you want to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task , the disruption of attention can lead to the torance , &quot; indicated Mark J. Fagke , a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guph , in 11 , and one of the authors of the study .
&quot; on the other hand , when you are doing something boring , like to detect defective pieces in a manufacturing line , a music that you distracted you can help do not hang on . &quot;
&apos;de facto , we know now that moving or engaging , actions that are often interpreted as a fable , can actually help combat it , as they make that person physically more alert . &quot;
&quot; the research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and have more information than those to whom they are forced to stay , &quot; says Professor Fagke .
we all know what it is at some point in the past : the delay of an aircraft , a monotone speaker , a particularly boring film .
but some people are more likely to be tainted than others .
to help measure it , some researchers developed in the 1980 &quot; s a &quot; race @-@ driven scale . &quot;
the scale includes issues such as &quot; many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monoas &quot; and &quot; there is so much that I am interested in not having time to do everything . &quot;
, Mr van Hulten , a teacher professor at the University of West Florida , claims that , using these levels , researchers have discovered that the boys are more likely to get involved than girls , and in particular they need more external and more varied stimulation .
but , generally speaking , teenagers are a group class that is boring quite easily .
in 1991 , Sted Larare , a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois , carried out an experiment in which it was in contact with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day by seeking .
he found that 32 % of teenagers said that he would be boring as he was in school or doing the homework , while 23 % said that he would be boring when he was not in school .
on the other hand , 3 % of the parents said that they would be boring .
Professor Larwas said that he did not know whether the percentages at present , 21 years later , would be superior or inferior .
but he said that what he did was &quot; adolescence is a period in which he is tired of his highest heights , &quot; largely because both children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control over what they want to do .
so , to return to my question of the principle : is it a bad thing ?
sometimes it is not , because , at the end of the day , it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks , such as making gambling or falling into the use of substances as a means of combating it , as research shows .
on the other hand , many philosophers and writers are talking about the connection between bleeding and creativity , according to the Professor Vøich , who has been studying this issue for more than two decades .
&quot; it is the way that you have the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else , &quot; says Gary Marus , a professor at the University of New York .
but the brain does not always know what is most appropriate .
if you are boring and use that energy to touch the piitle or cook , you will be happy to do so .
but if you look on television , you can be satisfied in the short term , but not in the long term .
&quot; so , if your son is boring and he is given an iad , it may no longer be boring , but he will not have learned to hand over himself or be made &quot; he says Professor Fagke .
and &apos; this capacity for measurement applies to other situations &apos; , points out .
his son not only learns to hand in hand on his own , but learns better control in other areas .
I do not think we really want to pay tribute to it .
but we should not be too critical of it either .
instead , our aim should be to feel comfortable in the constant rumour of activities and technologies .
Professor Eastwood is in agreement .
&quot; in our view , we need to have more of us , but it is a very distressing and disturbing desire to link it with something worthwhile , &quot; he claims .
it points out that what people really look for is a way to stop and enjoy time dead .
&quot; in an environment in which we are constantly overencouraged , &quot; he says , &quot; it is difficult to find ways of focusing our attention when noise stops . &quot;
conclude : without book of instructions for the new law on marijuana use
blindly , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old student at a Community institute and a player in the south @-@ east of Colorado , he is facing a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state : the possession of marijuana stones and a pia that used to smoke it .
he is saying that one day in September , he and some friends led to Lamar , on the plains close to the border of Kansas , when the police stopped .
the police found marijuana in the car , and a long time ago it received a court case for drug possession and related goods ( minor crimes involving each of the USD 100 fine ) in which it was informed of the date of the trial .
&quot; you treat us as criminals , &quot; he says .
and are they ?
in the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado to legalise the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drugs is less dependent on the law than on the location .
hundreds of minor crimes of marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington , where a similar measure was adopted .
the police departments have stopped presenting charges against the twenty @-@ five years of small @-@ scale possession , which will be legally approved once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks .
but the prosecutors of more conservative districts in Colorado have pledged to go ahead with the cases open to marijuana possession and are still quoting people .
at the same time , several cities , from the suburbs of Denver to the Western mountains , are voting to prevent the opening of marijuana shops , authorised recently , in their communities .
&quot; all of this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the following , &quot; he said Daniel J. Ohles , the police chief in Aora , just in the east of Denver .
those who deal with the rules in the state of Washington are also touching on the matter .
and they continue to seek advice to establish a system of licensing , manufacturing , distribution and sale ; all this before the deadline , on 1 December 2013 .
they say that , for better or for worse , Colorado is ahead of most states with regard to the regulation of marijuana use , first for therapeutic purposes , and now for recreational use .
&quot; Colorado has a more regulated market , so it will be a good guide , &quot; says Brian E. Smith , spokesperson for the Washington state of control of alcohol control .
but Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions as to what could work .
&quot; there is no real precedent that serves as a model , &quot; he claims .
Washington &apos;s law , called I @-@ 502 , enters into force on 6 December , which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters , as the licensing system in that state does not yet exist , but possession will be legal .
in addition , there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period , as a way of maintaining a balance between the demand for the state to be offered a &quot; adequate access &quot; to the authorised marijuana and its ban on cannabis business at a radius less than 300 metres in schools , parks , child @-@ playing areas , or children &apos;s centres .
&quot; nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorised cannabis business than in urban areas , especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle , &quot; says the centre of the Centre for legal cannabis , a group of research that has been set up recently .
on 21 November , the Chief of Police of Aora , he sent an e @-@ mail to his police officers in which he informed them that the city &apos;s prosecutor would no longer take legal action for minor mispossession to people over the age of 21 , and that the police would no longer present charges against such crimes &quot; with immediate effect . &quot;
the head of police said that they would be responsible for enforcing the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to persecute traffickers and drug dealers .
in the county of Wfeld , in the north of Colorado , the district prosecutor , Ken vick , represents a tougher view .
after the vote , he assured that his office would continue to pursue the cases of marijuana possession , mainly to put pressure on consumers and to decide on treatment .
at the moment , 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana , although many of them have other charges .
&quot; our office has the obligation to take legal action against those failures that were organised at the time when it was a crime , &quot; he said in a statement .
the response has been complicated even in places like the rural county of the Bureau , where voters rejected marijuana legalisation .
the police of Gand List , the largest county city , no longer quotes adults by possession of small amounts .
the prosecutor in the county district was supported by this decision , but he also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending by office .
&quot; I do not think that it is wasting its time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes , &quot; he claimed .
despite the fact that 55 % of voters supported the measure , it was never considered that taking the use of marijuana for recreational use within the government and the judiciary would be easy .
the contradictory reactions across the state reveal a sharp ambivalence among officials with regard to the great environmental experiment in this state .
&quot; it is a cultural barrier with the prosecutors in the district , &quot; says Sean McAllister , a Denver lawyer representing marijuana possession and is the local representative of the International Organization for the Reform of marijuana law .
&quot; they spent so much time pushing people before the courts that they cannot , in actual fact , still cannot accept to be legal , &quot; he claimed .
as it is the first states that consider the small quantities of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol , Colorado and Washington , they are preparing to become the test cases at national level with regard to the legalisation of drugs .
as lawyers and state officials count on a new border of legal sales , they are also anxious to receive indications from the federal government , which still provides for the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes .
advocates of marijuana legalization have the hope that the Department of Justice will give in .
despite some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes , the Federal Government has , in its majority , allowed the sale of marijuana to be used for these purposes in Colorado , Washington and 16 more states .
&quot; though it is likely that drug agents will not throw off a small drug exchange , they will probably be reluctant to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use , &quot; he said Kald A , an ex @-@ drug policy adviser to the Obama administration .
several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act .
even before the election day , some local governments approved defaults on any new marijuana shops , even though it will be around a year before any of them can open .
last week , a six @-@ month ban was adopted in the western city of Montroen , and it is likely to be approved next week .
&quot; we do not want to put ourselves in a position in which we authorise someone , then we have a serious problem at federal level , &quot; explained Bob Nicholson , a member of the city .
&quot; our community voted against this amendment .
we are studying in favour of what the community voted against voting in favour of what the state voted for . &quot;
there are a lot of questions about this .
the Wyatt : &quot; I was harassed until I was Oxford as a Tory . &quot;
universities are not being attacked for their views only now .
I remember no time in my life where you have not been dreaming of getting a square at the Oxford University .
both my father and my younger brother had been in which I meant the world &apos;s best to learn , a Greek symposium from the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilization : free thought and tolerance .
however , in the two weeks of my seat in the Work College at the end of the 1980s to take up the history race , it had already made its bags , which triggered the first life scandal .
my father collapsed and was shot down .
my friends were perplexed .
the newspaper The Evening Standard stated that I had abandoned because it did not tolerate a number of university colleagues holding sexual relations in the room .
the writer A. Wilson announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in a chucer .
the truth was less amusing .
I said that there was there .
yes , I died because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation .
not because of my extravagant name , nor the fact that it came from a private school .
I was harassed for one reason , which was somewhat intolerant and barbaric in the cradle of the alleged illustration : my father , the late WafastşWyatt , was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party .
perhaps you will ask what that is now about .
well , several reports indicate that a new generation of center @-@ right students is suffering similar persecution .
the institutionalised and growing hatred of students from the conservative party is such in Oxford that , last week , a group of them called for the same level of equal rights as homosexuals , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
a number of Conservatives in the Bureau ( the college of students &apos; grouping of students ) claim that they are &apos; often seriously paragraphs , personally attacked and treated as people who do not belong &apos; because of their political ideas .
they want to create a seat on the equal opportunity committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their opinions freely .
his situation was not helped by a recent documentary by the BOJ called &quot; Wonderland : Young , The Right and on the Riright &quot; : young , brilliant , and right @-@ wing students , and presented the Tories as eccentric and neo @-@ Nazis .
he brings the post @-@ Joe Cooke student , former Chairman of the Association of the Oxford University , in a Lancet @-@ Aldo , wearing a silver dress and a stick with the sword of silver .
in other universities , conservative students say they are treated like &quot; heads of Turkish &quot; by the introduction of higher tuition fees .
Bke Black , 20 years of and vice @-@ chairman of the University Association Association of the University of Pennsylvania , declared in a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there is a growing left @-@ wing trend in universities .
people assume that we are like the MoryuvClub without even knowing ourselves . &quot;
he says that this environment is &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; claiming that the motion for a better protection is &quot; uncomfortable &quot; and that the attitude of members of the NLD to people who are at the center of the center has become worse .
&quot; this is a threat to the environment of intellectual debate , as well as to the well @-@ being of the members , &quot; he claims .
for my first weeks in Oxford , I was more than the one .
I entered the university in September 1986 , it was a young of 18 years of terribly timid young .
the hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest .
last year , the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher , formerly a student , a &quot; perfect cause &quot; after the cuts in the funding of higher education .
the environment would have made a fuss about any Stalinist .
during the early days of the week of welcome to the new university , when new students are known and known to the teachers , I received a show of the bitterness that I was expecting .
I found that the professor did not just turn a blind eye to the way in which conservative university graduates were speaking , but that they were very much involved in it .
the anti @-@ apartheid policy of the miners , privatization and opposition of the government to anti @-@ apartheid sanctions in South Africa came to the wooden rooms of the seminar .
first of all , I was supposed to translate into English French texts of the eighteenth century and I was not prepared for what came next .
&quot; Mr Wyatt , &quot; he said of Professor Harry Paut ( already late ) , &quot; please , translate the first paragraph . &quot;
I did not produce one .
Gt , a low @-@ minded man with an face that seemed like bizarre mass , knew well how to expel bad biis .
&quot; don &apos;t you learn French , or do you refuse to learn French , or are you simply stupid ? &quot; he asked .
the other universities went .
I looked forward to the tears that he was trying to contain .
&quot; I suggest that you go to French classes in their free time , provided it is not too busy knowing , &quot; beautiful Pittella .
I returned to my room as a pity .
that night I sat alone at the time of the dinner at the university ; then I felt a light on the back .
he was a second @-@ year English student called James who was presented as a member of the OISA .
&quot; I know the person , &quot; he kindly told me .
&quot; I fear that this is the way it is .
they go with anyone who is suspected of being Tory .
for me it is very complicated , but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so for you it will be even worse for you .
many of the days are just coming to be Labour . &quot;
later on , in a local sob , I tried to disguise a mockery .
I insisted that she did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher said .
this trick proved useless .
a first year of the first year of Floray , Policy and Economy who , paradoxically , had studied in Eton , said : &quot; you are the daughter of a fascist pig .
it is contaminated . &apos;
other students took that Foreign Minister .
I became a dirty man .
&quot; how do you have sexual relations the Tories ? , &quot; you asked one .
&quot; you beat up each other , are you not ? &quot;
I felt in the same way that homosexuals should have felt prior to the liberal law of the 1960 &quot; s .
could it one day lead to a normal life in Oxford ?
would you be forced to stay with people I thought like me only after the clock ?
would you like to take a Labour and suppress my natural trends ?
the three years that I was expected to have been presented as a self @-@ seeking of ostracism and isolation .
the only professor in the open Tora , Professor Stone , professor of History First of History destined for my university college .
he was hate to be not only of the Conservative party , but also an adviser to Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote to him .
I was not there at all .
he had the place that he regarded it as provincial and insignificant , and by his adherence to the Marxist vision of history .
in 1997 , he accepted a presidential chair at the University of Balkent in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; you are not going to be happy here , &quot; he told me .
I started to move on my parents home daily from Oxford to my parents in London , finding refuge in my family friends and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality .
I told my father who hated Oxford and why .
I did not think so .
when he studied there in the 1950 &quot; s , all political views were accepted .
&quot; but if it is the best place in the world , &quot; he has saddened .
&quot; they would never do that , not among my loved needle @-@ stick .
until my Communist friends , they always had an impeccable attitude . &quot;
their painful eyes began to reproduce .
&quot; give you another opportunity .
I am sure they have done so only to joke .
I would be left to heart if I would leave it behind . &quot;
from so many trips to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
a friend of mine , who also supported the Conservative Party , had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed .
the following week , during a seminar in which another professor of History had implied , speaking completely seriously , that I was an &quot; people &apos;s enemy , &quot; I chose to do the same .
shame on within , I admitted that my parents had &quot; laundering the brain &quot; and I called them &quot; old stupid . &quot;
the truce was short @-@ lived .
it was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford .
at that time my father wrote two columns weekly in the Murdoch press .
my door was closed with key ones .
I was on the side of fear and , in the last five minutes , my loved supporters abandoned .
when I went on to the bad thing , I got the first train to London .
I never returned .
perhaps I am called the weak cry .
but no person of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution .
what is even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party , but is now hiding behind a reputation that was not worthy of equality and freedom of thought .
&apos;Feino prefers elegance to visibility &apos; .
on the occasion of the show &quot; Geino : the master of the shelf , &quot; which was opened this week in London , ABC talks with Naty Ageo , Fiona Thyssen @-@ Bornabza , and other famous Italian designer users .
Cambridge , the ancient home of Elizabeth I of England , is the only place in British capital worthy of welcoming an exhibition on designer Garavani .
the design recognised it during the opening of &quot; Fino : teacher of the cost , &quot; a retrospective fechtey that meets more than 130 dressed in the high cost of his &quot; Sson &quot; over the past 50 years .
&quot; to be gold for this palace , &quot; he says with his unmistakable Italian emphasis .
this is the culmination of a story whose only major player is &quot; il il &quot; Garavani , but which could not have been written without his distinguished climate .
he has always been fascinated by the far @-@ fetched and distant world of the nobility .
in the first round of this exhibition , open to 3 March , there are plenty of private letters and photographs with the signing of the lion &apos;s share of the aristocracy , from the Princess Sharah Aga Khan to Lord Safhadon , via the Princeton Marie @-@ Chisal of Greece and Mararita from England .
to hide these personal memories as a trophy of their social rise : of the humble theory of the town of Vafera , in the north of Italy , in the wake of the international &quot; ring @-@ set . &quot;
it is not a bad thing to do so .
&quot; at least , they will not turn off the odds of their pars on their magnificent carpet as they make some beautiful celebrities of pop music , &quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen @-@ Bornabza .
in the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s , both lived in the Alps and were good friends .
it is a spectacular host to have a strong host , and it is generous and elegant .
&quot; we were all happy to be invited to his chat in Gstad , &quot; explains the former woman of &quot; Heini &quot; Thyssen , the intimate of forgotten beautiful , such as Marella Aachelli or Eraenie Nowoly .
he has always preferred an elegance to visibility .
and yet it is a star .
that is the case in the past , which is the first to be the case , and I am thinking about the fact that I have been in the dark .
the Argentine model Valituuza also does not forget the charisma of the theory .
many years ago , after a parade in Piñera , in Rome , we went to dinner on the floor .
we were twenty people , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy .
in every detail of the floor , the prayer , the food , the music , everything was seen and felt by its spirit .
&quot; every one of the guests made us feel important and dear , &quot; recalls the &quot; top @-@ down &quot; , which began working with it during the High cost Week in Paris in 1995 .
&quot; it is never fashionable because its designs are works of art , &quot; fire .

the life of Garavani is not a history of obitum , but of well @-@ suited .
he loves people with good education and better titles , and they love him .
one of the Sinerset House has been transformed into a powerful passerelle of 60 metres , which proposes a change of role : the visitor takes the place of models , and must go through the passerelle to contemplate a &quot; audience &quot; that looks like the clothes that have been chosen by Jacek Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis , the blog that was used by Monica Vitti in &quot; La Vitti &quot; , or a cup of wool and skin belonging to the Eperenenuta Farba Farba .
there are names in this public of parquos like the name of the Luxembourg of Luxembourg , Gloria von Three taxi , Mete @-@ Mart of Norway , Rosales of Bulgaria or Sofia .
Cambridge and Agegey and the amending , in 2006
many of these weather say that the first designer is the first love , &quot; impossible to forget . &quot;
I remember that very well .
it was a quack , a straitjacket , a chuctte &apos; gitte &apos; and a jacket of the last autumn @-@ winter 1971 @-@ 1972 .
&quot; he was a gift that he did , &quot; he says Park and Atuza , one of the designer .
&quot; I prefer it above others because of her femininity , because of their great love for women , because it reincreases our beauty , &quot; adds the former Duquel of Fair .
I like much of the colours you use , you have a great light , and they are &quot; donors &quot; in the face .
the proportions are perfect .
in the first time I had the first time you could forget the very first time you were the first time you did not forget the fashionable prescription of the fashion and the fashionable driver of the theory of the life of Mrs Ernst d &apos;Arenberga .
when I was a teenager and lived in Italy , I dreamed that he was going to have the age and the opportunity to use one of his suits at night ...
finally , the time was arrived at the end of the 1990s .
I bought my first dress of designer to use on a party in my own house , the Prince Edoard de Lipponen .
it was a red suit , with a ring of flight , &apos; cut off &apos; , and listen to the word of honour .
&quot; it was a dream made a dream , &quot; he says the widow of Rostgo d &apos;Arenberg .
&apos;Feino is indifferent to the fashion , your obsession is the semi @-@ statement &apos; , explains this beloved Italian man who is living in Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
the YD &apos;Arenberg is keeping its heads in the party of the theory of &quot; the highest care ... because a dress is not just a dress , it is also the set of memories that it entails . &quot;

according to the journalist , Sweden , the journalist , the journalist , the journalist , Sodel Menkis , the specialist press is a milestone in the high cost of the late twentieth century , &quot; the return of the climate for the high society . &quot;

from the high @-@ ranking distinction in Italy , an ally in the high @-@ ranking distinction in Italy , Cavaba from L &apos;ordire des Arits et des Le3 , a joar of the Honor , Garavani accumulates so many honours as any of the spouses of his climate .
&apos;Let me always draw attention to your refinement , your calm , your aspect , and perfect &apos; , recognises D &apos;Arenberg .

&quot; he was impeccable , time does not pass on him . &quot;
if you say so , ...
the world &apos;s strongest job : the humans of Kawah Ijin
for four euros , the Indonesian volcano operators are playing their lives and health at 70 kilograms of sulphur through paved paths .
there are people for whom his work is hell and one that literally works in hell .
this is the case with Anto speak , one of the 400 miners who earn their living from the sulphur of the volcano Kawah Ijin , east of the Indonesian island of Jva .
to do so , he has to go down every day to the bottom of his clone , where the sulfurous gas that comes from the front of the earth is strengthened by entering into contact with the air .
after a lot of large sulphur rocks , in total , even 70 kilograms , they have to be found in two brooo brooo on their shoulders through their founding of stone paths .
it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which is rising to 2,386 meters of altitude , but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to move at a snail &apos;s pace , balancing the balance and measuring their steps so as not to slip back and fall down on the cliff .
they know that any crossing could cost them life , as was the case for a French tourist who took off years ago by Kawah Ijen .
the miners of Kawah Ijon earn 5 cents per kilo of sulphur that they extract .
once on the top , there is a way for tourists to be opened up as if they were a circus and , on the spot , flying three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has put a bit further down , to 1,850 metres .
this is the PT Candi Nliimbi , a company that has been exploiting the volcano and , never again , its workers , who pay 662 Euro @-@ 62 euro cents ( 5 cents ) per kilo of sulphur .
then you sell it for 10 000 rupee ( 83 euro cents ) to the petrochemical industry , since this mineral is widespread in daily life and is used to manufacture fireworks , fireworks , cosmetics , dynamite and even to escape sugar .
&quot; as normal is to load 70 kilograms , we get around 46,000 of the items ( EUR 3.8 ) in every trip , &quot; he explains to us , who often does three daily reports .
it leads to three hours in each and every one , but it allows them to share 138,000 Russian ( EUR 11.5 ) at the end of the day .
although it appears to be a pittance for such inhumane efforts , it is triple what it would be in the countryside .
&quot; the miners &quot; Day is very high here , where the wheat collection is paid to 15 000 rupee ( EUR 1.2 ) the day and the average monthly salary is two million rupee ( EUR 167 ) , clarifies the carrier , which was previously working in the island tourist of Bali .
there , his salary was of 75 billion euros ( EUR 6.2 ) the day and the pill was not so hard , but Anto has returned with his family to Bafwi , a people close to the volcano , for a serious reason that , in Indonesia , is as strong as the sulphur : I was married to a young of Bali , where he is Hindu , and brought him to Jva to turn to Islam . &quot;
mine has asthma , breathing with difficulty , constantly tobly , and is angry about toxic gases .
in its 27 years , the Anward has three playing its head in the Kawah Ijin , whose sulphur has already begun to pass on to the face of the face of special mask and mask .
it has asthma , it is difficult , it is constantly touching and it is angry about the toxic gases fired by the volcano .
it is the price to be paid to achieve their dream .
&quot; I will work for two years more because I want to open a Spanish or French shop , &quot; he promises in a more than acceptable English .
being responsible for life , this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide , shrimp or hotel reception , but he does not do the job .
on the other hand , a herd has the herd of wood , with other operators , that every day is lifted at 2 a.m. because sulphur does not stop running overnight , when its holy colour becomes blue and is in the midst of darkness .
in the shadow of the shadows , I would like to say that I have a small farm in order to join its hull , which it has purchased with its money itself .
in the light of the report , 400 of them are loaded with sulphur on their shoulders .
despite their high @-@ profile profits , the mining company has not orchestrated the extraction of sulphur in order to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the airline operators who work on their own and as much as possible .
in fact , they do not even see part of the 30 000 mega @-@ euros ( EUR 2.5 000 ) in camera , which , together with the entrance of 15 000 rupee ( EUR 1.2 ) , will be charged with the tourists who go to terrorise the volcano and its people .
&quot; this work is for the baby , not for the people , &quot; protests Madhwithout , a 42 @-@ year @-@ old mankn who has been in the Kawah Ijin three decades , since the school left .
unable to lift up to 110 kilograms , he ensures that he will keep on working &quot; whatever he can &quot; because he needs the money to educate his three children from between 18 and 10 years .
I will not retire , I will die here because the volcano has been all my life .
even if sulphur burn off and flies in the eyes when the wind is shifting from time to time and trapping the miners in the columns of the volcano , they are so hard that none is complaining about suffering from serious diseases - beyond , of course , their usual respiratory problems , artrosis , pain on the knees and wades on the shoulders , which have been misled on the shoulders of those people .
breaking the basket on your back , Unak can only load 50 kg to its 53 years .
every day , he and his colleagues set aside 15 tonnes of sulphur to the volcano , which means that three lorries move to the store of Tamansari , 18 kilometres away from a bone of goats between the evil .
&quot; I will not retire , I will die here because the volcano has been all my life , &quot; proclaims Uninatk by opening the mouth , where he lacks a number of teeth .
of your five children , the elderly , 30 years of age , are also working on sulphur .
time is running out , but misery perpetuates generation in generation of one of the world &apos;s toughest trades : that of the humans of Kawah Ijen .
the Economy \ u0027s People &apos;s Economy for Save the Economy
the hard house blame the race , stress , and cost of property and education because they do not have children .
&quot; the people of Singapore need to grow . &quot;
I am a patriotic husband , are my patriotic wife , let us live with our civic duty and create life !
it may seem unlikely that these lights will be part of an announcement of baby tablets , but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year .
the sentences are part of a needle using local references such as &quot; we are going to put a sponsor in the &quot; don &apos;t &quot; to laugh at the birth rate of Singapore .
the video company that made the video , BBH , hopes that with the announcement they will succeed in drawing attention to the problem in a different way .
his creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says he wanted to use the music to keep people to &quot; his national duty . &quot;
this is something purely of the Internet , so we had to make it fun and fun .
this is the biggest problem in this country .
we are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves , so we feel that this was an issue that we had to address .
we knew that the government had tried a great deal , like to launch a court of law and to organise fast @-@ notice .
many of these ideas may have been creative , but not necessarily worked .
so , we think , why do we not do as creative as possible to solve this problem , which is to set up a needle ?
the Children &apos;s Children
the government of Singapore is not taken so lightly .
it spends US $ 1.3 per year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children .
a government package for marriage and marriage gives up to $ 15,000 per child , extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits .
but all of this has had little effect .
Singapore is a rich and high @-@ tech city in Southeast Asia , also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its stringent social controls .
the birth rate in Singapore , in accordance with its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
the last time it was above 2 - known as a new rate - was in 1976 .
so why do wolves have no more children ?
as Wei Ming , the Minister of Policy Director of the Mrenliy and Family of the National Population Division , he says it is due to a &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a broader range of career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; that has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities , beyond marriage and a family . &quot;
these changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in plaice , and to delay marriage and births , resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
in the meantime , an immigration policy that is leading to increasing immigration to deal with the decline in population has created resentment among the local population .
in Singapore , there are websites where there is little xenophobia disguised against many new immigrants , especially the Chinese , who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating .
increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore &apos;s government party experienced its worst electoral result since independence last year .
since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the quotas and higher charges for foreign workers .
unexpected consequences
while the fall in the birth rate has effects known in the economic growth of a nation , tax revenues , health costs , and immigration policies , the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences .
the government is trying not to build so many small houses .
for example , it has started to affect the housing sector .
the urban development authority has moved to control the number of small flats , known as &quot; shoes box , &quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city .
these flats have areas of 46 square metres and have been very successful .
however , there are concerns that they can promote a carrot @-@ and @-@ life style and discourage developers who want to build large , family houses .
but Lim Yw Soon , Director @-@ General of the house buildings , says that his &quot; pockets of shoes &quot; are sold much faster than larger units .
they are more popular in the sense that the units are exhausted , even weeks , faster than the largest units .
that makes it much better for our cash flow .
however , it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers , who were previously obstructed if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project .
too stressed
Singapore is a city state .
while these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , talking to the hard @-@ liners who work in the centre &apos;s financial district appears that they will not have much effect .
&quot; people are deeply stressed , homes are expensive , and so is education , so many people are postponing it , &quot; says a young executive .
other people can have children .
&quot; but for me it is important to have my own money and time , &quot; he says another young one about 20 years .
men and women mention their career , the stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons why they are prevented from having children .
so , however much the government is trying to push its citizens to have children , when it comes to making babies , it is those who have the last word .
the private off @-@ on @-@ line private on the line
privacy .
according to the verbatim report by the Royal Academy Academy , it is a matter of private quality or the area of private life which is entitled to protect any interference . &quot;
what is private for a minimum of 16 years ?
how does it apply this definition in their daily lives and in social networks ?
does the dangers to which the Internet is exposed in the Internet tend not to share out the line ?
Perisóal interviewed five children from the age of ten to 15 years - frequent users of the network .
in four cases , he associated the term &quot; something very much of my &quot; , and &quot; in the key and the name of the user , &quot; when it applied to social networks .
&quot; my deepest secrets would not raise them to a post , &quot; says George , ten years ago , when he tries to explain the private meaning on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Hote , and Window Littger , where he has been accountable for two years .
&quot; they are very secret secrets , my breast will be able to know them , but not everyone , &quot; he says .
in FB sub @-@ pictures of fine images or games .
I have my well @-@ known knowledge also .
&quot; I would not share a photo that is not mine , or of someone who is making ridicule , &quot; he says .
the child recognises that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs , of naked people , of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments .
George assures the 35 of his friends that he has in FB and his nine followers on Twitter .
most are relatives .
the mother is included , and he has the key to one of the accounts .
I took Twitter to speak and to write interesting lines .
&quot; I don &apos;t know whether you are answering me , I only have the subones , &quot; he adds .
&quot; the social networks are handed over , I can speak with distant relatives or my friends quickly , &quot; it indicates .
he would certainly accept that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
he would not ask someone to recommend it to a strange .
the case of José , of 14 years , is different .
the teenager has open accounts in Hote , Facebook , Me , and Ask , on the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added on their list of friends .
&quot; I am not afraid , because we have something in common , music , for example , &quot; indicates .
according to the child , neither has been hinted at nor has he asked for the management of his house or his telephone number .
&quot; if you pressed for me or asked me the floor of my own , &quot; acknowledges .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council was a supporter of Ask , after reading a recommendation on Twitter .
the experience of what is known today is not an alien to the child .
a well @-@ known one of my friend was blackmailing him in a social network .
they threatened it and demanded money .
&quot; never knew who was , &quot; he claims .
the victim , he José , did not shut down the bill .
&quot; he has only put him privacy . &quot;
it then explains a number of steps to make it safe .
unlike George , this boy would rise photos of known in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
I would do so , if I am wrong or I am keen .
&quot; although I know that this is cyber @-@ lighting , &quot; he claims .
key questions
the English teacher and a teacher in education and apprenticeship believe that the purpose of the social networks is to inform children and adolescents .
&quot; the Internet emerged as a means to search for information , but on the side of these sites the rules of the game were changed , &quot; he mentions .
he points out that the academic Marc Prensky , a master of teaching by the University of Yale and deputy author of the native labor and Inmigrants , coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
the natives are they , the children and young people born with the technology .
&quot; we are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them , when we are still learning , &quot; he says .
he says that the subject is a complex one , &quot; because we are asking you to have a clear criterion on what is appropriate or not to disseminate , publish or say at an age that maturity does not provide us . &quot;
&quot; also that they are selective when what matters most is to be popular , have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences , &quot; adds .
according to the specialist , the most effective way of teaching the privacy of children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect .
&quot; saying it does not do it does not work , &quot; he adds .
next , there is some choice : there are things that do not give it to one strange , why do you do so on the Internet ?
or would you like to publish a man &apos;s photograph as the one that is published by a friend ?
do you know what others are publishing about you ?
when labels of Christmas labels , do you give permission to the other people to label them ?
and one more thing : do you all need to know what you are doing at every moment ?
another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do on off .
it is the same rules .
&quot; one out of the Internet acts with respect , morality , and other principles , just as it should be in social networks , &quot; he claims .
support
I would like to say a few words about the fact that a university teacher , a university teacher , a primary teacher and an educational consultant , says that it is essential for family parents to read the policies of social networks .
by understanding each one of the incentives , they have a strong foundation for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet .
&quot; for example , age , and what it is allowed to share or publish , &quot; he says .
according to the Guard , it is essential to remind children of the lesson of &quot; not with strangers . &quot;
the Lima Summit without making public the Lima Declaration
the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Unaur ) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration , which was announced previously and theoretically , signed by the seven officials who have been signed , was concluded in Peru .
the E was repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth ordinary meeting of Heads of State or Government of the Unasur , but the sources of Chancellor and the Presidency pointed out that they were going to hand over after the closure , but then said that it will at some point be published on the Peruvian Government &apos;s website .
by being consulted on the text , they pointed out that the content had been put forward by the President of Peru , Oéta Humala , for brief statements to the press .
the access of journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times .
during the past , it was only passed in the press room , the free video of the presidential assembly with the message &quot; private , unrestricted sitting . &quot;
the little information that was circulating among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of the Unan assistants , even though not Peru .
the only document released during the time was the list of assistants , which caused the unrest of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were calling for greater data .
subsequently , Peru &apos;s Presidency sent an e @-@ mail to the media with the summit &apos;s &quot; final declaration , &quot; but it is the statement by Humala , and not the official document that closed the summit .
in October , Peru was the host of the 3rd South @-@ Arab South America Summit , and on that occasion , even though it was persistently demanded by the press , it was also not published in the so @-@ called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced .
on the official site of APA , it is possible to confirm that the document was published on Tuesday .
on both international meetings , the Peruvian authorities made efforts at the fact that there were insured transmission systems for all journalists , but they limited the collection of information as much as possible .
the summit also concluded with Chile &apos;s and Peru &apos;s joint commitment to accepting a ruling by the Hague Court that would make a difference between the two countries .
Peru &apos;s presidents , Oéta Humala , and of Chile , Kalimantan , met during the regional quotation and ratified that will respect the ( CIJ ) decision , beginning on Monday in The Hague to listen to the claims on both sides , in the Lima process brought against Santiago .
&quot; we will abide and implement the judgment that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today &quot; , Humala , along with his couple of Chilean , said .
&quot; Chile has been , is and will remain a country respectful of international law , of the peaceful settlement of disputes , of the treaties and of the international courts , &quot; he added , and welcomed his hands on Humala , together with the flags of the two countries .
the confirmation of both presidents that they will be subject to the CIJ then happened that Colombia would denounce the Bogota Pact this week that it had agreed to be subject to the failures of this international court , following a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that was seriously wrong .
the summit was held with the absence of the French presidents , Dilma Rouhani ; Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , Bolivia , Evo Morales ; and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
Paraguay , suspended from Unaiur since 2011 , following the removal of his former President Fernando Lugo , did not take part in the quotation .
the host president , Oéta Humala , was charged with opening up discussions in the morning and closing the summit , shortly after midday in Lima .
the representative read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total of $ 17 billion in investment .
among the agreements adopted mentioned the fact that the countries of UNRWA will take &apos; important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence &apos; .
it reported that action is being taken to improve &apos; cooperation in the fight against citizens &apos; insecurity and against transnational organised crime , action to make medicines more accessible , access to the Internet at a price in all corners of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with the risks of natural disasters &apos; .
with a Europe in crisis , &quot; economic consolidation ( from Latin America ) should not have a triumphant parent , but should serve to expand the productive parent and see a better future for our people , &quot; added Humala .
&quot; we have chosen to favour a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South American areas , especially in rural and border areas - bringing our countries together and generating new economic circuits , &quot; said the Peruvian President in a message read .
among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru , and they are located on the cross @-@ cutting axes of their territory , from the coast to Brazil , and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador , although it did not give greater details .
the final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay .
&apos;We hope that the electoral process in that country will be used to return to the Union of South American Nations , which is currently excluded .
the need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace , integrated , and good relations between neighbors , was another of the issues highlighted by the summit .
in this sense , Colombia &apos;s president , Juan Manuel Santos , said before he began his participation in the regional quotation that he hoped to meet with his couple of Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday in Mexico to deal in a respectful manner in respectful of the different maritime carriers following an CIJ ruling , questioned by Bogota .
&quot; tomorrow &apos;s morning ( Saturday ) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega , &quot; Santos said .
&quot; we are going to review all these paths , they are not exclusive , including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; with President Ortega , I hope to be able to tell him that we manage this in the most civilised and respectful way , &quot; he added Santos .
Santos and Ortega would be found on Saturday in Mexico where they are planning to attend the leadership of that country &apos;s new president , Enrique Peña Nieto .
also , as part of the summit , the bloc Defense Ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , South Africa , and Paraguay are integrated , even though the latter country is suspended .
Peru has the pro @-@ regional presidency presidency .
&quot; South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship &quot; : Raphael .
the president of Ecuador , Raphael , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which &quot; South America , in this case yes , must learn from Europe . &quot;
ironically , which took part in the Union &apos;s sixth presidential summit of Nations ( Unaur ) , held in Lima , he told state TV that Europeans &quot; were killed in World War II &quot; and in other conflicts , &quot; but are now practically a homeland . &quot;
he supported , in this sense , the project of establishing the American citizenship that the member countries of Unasur encourage .
&quot; we must secure the free movement of citizens and workers from any South American country , as is the case with the Andean Community members , but there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past , &quot; he warned .
the deputy president was also in favour of the re @-@ position of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo @-@ Saxon states and taking account of those who signed the San José pact on human rights .
those who take the chair are never committed to anything , and we in the American countries signed everything together .
&quot; it is incomprehensible that the Inter @-@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States , &quot; he stated in the wake of the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange .
he has assured him that he does not regret this decision because he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his &apos; profound values of democracy and human rights &apos; .
he noted that , at the time , &quot; there were justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country , and that his process would not be respected . &quot;
he also criticized Swedish justice for calling for interrogation to be submitted on its territory by a alleged sexual offence when &quot; the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out by video conference , which could be done since the Ecuador of Ecuador in London . &quot;
Santiago said that there is a risk that Assange &apos;s physical and mental health will deteriorate .
&quot; I did not speak to him since he was in our embassy , but he informed me that he had a small lung problem , nothing &quot; , he said the incumbent .
what is at stake is the danger of their physical and mental health being damaged because they are locked in a small space without being able to make exercises in the open air .
&quot; that complicates the health of any person , &quot; he added .
2. he pointed out that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June in the Bavarian embassy in London , by granting a saving to allow him to travel to Ecuador , is in the hands of Britain , Sweden , and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been discussions with London in search of a solution to the confinement of WikiLeaks &quot; founder .
we do not negotiate with human rights , that word is not used in this case , but there has been ongoing discussion .
&quot; the solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities because Mr Assange &apos;s lawyer , Baltaar Garzon , is making a number of procedures in different European bodies , &quot; he mentioned .
it was of the opinion that &apos; if Great Britain gives tomorrow the vote on it &apos; .
and if Sweden , as it is perfectly able to do , and as it has done in other cases , asks Mr Assange in the Ecuador of Ecuador in London , or on the road to Skopje tomorrow , is the end of the problem .
he has used to assert himself as a defender of press freedom , and made a distinction that what he does not tolerate is &quot; mediocrity , bad faith , and lie , which distort freedom of expression . &quot;
&quot; the greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not evil and evil politicians but bad journalists on the basis of profit , blackmail and extortion , &quot; he said .
in this respect , it was welcomed that it is no longer these journalists &quot; neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador , &quot; and pre @-@ re @-@ elected &quot; to be re @-@ elected &quot; in the revolution in order to continue the path and the right direction . &quot;
the decision also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay at least until its next election , arguing that the body &quot; must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the coup d &quot; rule of law &quot; because it really did &quot; destroy the legitimacy of the rule of democracy . &quot;
in addition , the Chief President considered &apos; perfectly relevant &apos; the desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel Santos , to negotiate now with Nicaragua from the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , which benefited the Icelandic Department of Justice .
at the moment , this failure is not being taken up .
it is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country .
conflicts are inevitable , but they must be overcome by the will to walk together .
they need to be processed extensively to overcome them and to move forward .
it also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime limits that maintain in the same court in Peru and Chile , and believed that &quot; it is right for Latin America to look for international bodies if both countries commit themselves to accepting a failure by hard . &quot;
referring to the eventuality that he is present as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term , he pointed out that he sees this possibility &quot; with great optimism and joy , though sometimes rather hard . &quot;
he has confirmed that if he loses the February election of 2013 , he will withdraw from public life .
personally , I have never been interested , but in such unfair situations such socio @-@ economic poverty can only be corrected from political power .
&quot; my polite movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that likely victory , because we have to accept that reponent , &quot; he said .
it would be my last period in the presidency , and that is why we were out of public life .
if we lose the same .
&quot; it is a decision , &quot; he said .
the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba was also referred to .
I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice @-@ President Nicholas Maduro and he tells me that he travelled to a process that was already planned , in a routine way , that the campaign to return to Cuba was expected to pass .
&quot; does not mean a relapse into President Chávez &apos;s state of health , &quot; he commented .
the head of state was involved in Lima today at the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( Unaur ) which ended up with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
deaths from AIDS today are the cause of late detection
it was 21 years old when it confirmed the outcome of the test : positive AIDS .
&quot; it was as if I was a bomb , &quot; referring to recalling the timing of the announcement , which the doctor sought to make &quot; more cut @-@ off , &quot; without obvious success .
the child concealed him from his family .
he decided to take over his illness , and he began to inform him about it ; with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his birthday 43 .
it is , of course , one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit in the Civil Hospital in Guchampions ( HCG ) , which it reached in 1994 after various battles .
the HIV virus ( HIV ) virus ( HIV ) virus has been living with the virus for 22 years , which is difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s , when there were many doubts , few options for treatment , and more stigma .
then , even the director of an IMO clinic prevented him from being thrown out of him because he had a cut @-@ off . &quot;
AIDS was then synonymous with death .
it is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with a quality of life .
however , ignorant of his illness , many people still reach when the virus has already caused havoc , &quot; exhausted &quot; its immune system and fall victim to opportunistic infections .
to 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world , at least from the first cases reported , &apos; the great achievement at the moment means that a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the over @-@ living of the general population , is exactly the same &apos; , indicated the head of the HCG unit of HIV , after referring to the fact that this information was supported in April this year in a prestigious publication of scientific publication .
the scientists had concluded that from 2008 , the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment since 2008 , and the years of survival and quality of life depend on the immune system that patients are presenting .
in simple words , this means that whoever receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age , under these terms , &quot; as long as it remains in control , can live without problems until the 75 years , &quot; explained the interviewed .
to raise this advance , it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average .
while mortality has declined significantly in recent years , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 ( 2006 annual report ) , it is also true that from the onset of AIDS , 60 % of patients in the national database have died .
in 2011 alone , 255 people died in 2011 , and they are 187 deaths until May this year ; however , there is a guarantee that there is universal access to anti @-@ retroviral drugs since 2005 .
- Why are there still deaths ?
I believe that this is not a matter of access to treatment .
that is how we see it , and so it has happened to us in our hospital .
at least in the past 12 years we have not had the problem of the problem that patients have come very advanced because they do not know their state of infection , or in the late stages of the disease .
it gave a strong message : &quot; nine out of ten patients arrive when some opportunistic infection already presents what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality , is to make diagnosis more early and , therefore , have to offer evidence of mass detection , to all people who require it . &quot;
in its proposal there are specialists and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council , including the patients themselves , such as Fopen , who came to be tested in a particular laboratory , only motivated because a friend had done so and , despite his short age , was already in the age of AIDS and even suffered from Kaotney , a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications .
everything changes when you know that you have AIDS .
some people think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything .
&quot; if I am going to die three times a week &quot; I am going to die , say not in my case .
the change was to improve , I am food well , I use , I take the medicines .
to date , their parents know only that they suffered cancer .
I live a normal life , like anyone .
&quot; work , I have many activities , I travel , I have an active , but biased , sexual life to me and to the other person , &quot; listed Furio , who agreed to share his with Millennium Department of Justice to motivate his testimony to those who today , within the framework of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
if they are tested , if they were at risk , if they know whether they are positive HIV , it is better and if they already have the diagnosis , that they learn that they can live as anyone , who is responsible .
that , your message , summarises the battle slogan for AIDS this 2012 .
the Wtor ?
these are the gaps between health programmes and the common citizen , Mr Ricardo Salchance , a journalist which has taken on the cause of HIV .
the greatest is in prevention .
in places devoted to this task , &quot; it has indeed increased the distribution of condoms , before you gave us one or two , now you give us 100 % packages , and that is all very well , but there are those who still do not have access to a condoms today , &quot; he said .
among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
&quot; why do you want them ? &quot; it is a common question , with deaf people and the social workers &quot; guiding trials , school makers , pharmacies employees , who are not wanted to be exposed by teenagers .
it proposes to redirect this ineffective distribution ; that condoms are not just after the show , and those hundred are in public expeditors in the places that young people come up with .
it is not a reason to motivate a bid to go .
it is not a question of paying off them and using them , as the governor Eayo González responded by asking whether he would have distributed the condoms in his administration .
&quot; this is not sexuality , it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already involved in sexual activity , &quot; he pointed out .
in the case of the European Parliament , we should also be looking at the situation in the United States .
there are 1435 accumulated cases ( 12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV ) .
the state is four national places in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13 ° of HIV .
seventy per cent of the infection corresponds to the sexual route , 6 % on the blood route and 2 % on the perinatiity .
it is estimated that 50 thousand people can live with HIV because there are 4 to 5 people who do not know .
unanimously by a court of appeals from the United States , a judgment that is unfamiliar with the restructuring of the vitro Group &apos;s debt to Mexico , the scenario puts a disastrous precedent for any national company with ramifications in neighbouring countries with solvency problems .
it would therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the signatures that the Mexican laws permit are not valid in the country of bars and stars , in the counter @-@ hair of international conventions .
on the practical side , the support given to the judgment issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale from the court of bankruptcies for the northern district of Texas , leaves the Mexican signatures defenceless against the possibility of the embargo on their property in the rest of the Bro .
however , the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court , citing three inconsistencies .
from the outset , while the judge of the cause points out that creditors must abide by the United States &quot; Misleading Act , the appeals court in New Orleans , the appeal court in New Orleans , says that the main procedure is the commercial competition in Mexico .
the first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of the insolvency of companies with transnational profile .
to this end , the United Nations Act for the uniformity of the International Mervol Law was created to this end , and the American Lw Institute is being put on the referee .
second , the ruling states that without the inter @-@ company vote , recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition that had their debts with their parent , the majority required to approve the restructure would not have been achieved .
however , the possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws .
in fact , in vitro , it was not the first case that the scheme was accepted .
there are a half @-@ dozen examples of this , including the Iberian trade and former trade in the MaexIana , whose cross @-@ border debts supported the Federal Institute for Markets .
the truth is , moreover , that by taking the votes of subsidiaries , the vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States , that is to say the &quot; vulture &quot; funds such as the Pannos Capital of the International and Liverpool Fund , will not have achieved a majority .
the vote would have been 45 % against 37 .
this is omitted by the Court of appeals .
from another angle , this is in vitro the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 to escape from the serious economic crisis facing the United States , with the country being linked to the country .
for the time being , the signing of the González Álvarez family will be called upon to re @-@ examine the appeals court itself so that the vote can come to the plenary session , in other words the five magistrates , given that they only voted for three .
it is not to be achieved that this is to be called for by the de minimis appeal that is required to be reviewed by a higher body , in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States .
the seriousness of the case is that the court failed to pass a document sent out by the government of Mexico on a curious par , detailing the procedure followed in vitro under the Law on Trade competitions , pointing out that it was drowned in the agreements signed by both countries in order to draw Chapter 15 of the US bankruptcy law .
moreover , it is stated that the country met the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade , that is to say the rules set for cross @-@ border cases of insolvency , which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors .
the two @-@ way bands : go on in vitro and stick to the country .

Pactio on the Dragon
meeting at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean , a group of national and foreign environmentalists , academics , businessmen , and members in general of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese quartet in Cancún .
as you know , we are talking about a colossal travel centre and distribution of goods from the wall country to Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , with an area of housing at the price for employees of 150 companies .
previously the Canary Islands had managed to unify the governors of the south @-@ east region in order to oppose the monumental man who swept away part of protected areas and raises the mother of all honour against industry .
the ACTA
to pass on to the government a demand from the Senate to explain the terms and circumstances of the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti @-@ Terrorism Trade Agreement , known as ACTA , according to the Ifree Institute of Industrial Property , was passed on to the file .
as you know , the action was given despite the fact that the Senate itself had dismissed the possibility of seeing it as the violation of freedom of expression in social networks .

Hétor &apos; Hein &apos; One : &apos; the trap has been my life &apos; .
there were more than 60 years old linked to the sport in the sand sport and , thanks to him , went to the whole world .
few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the city &apos;s history as broad as the Hétor &quot; Hein &quot; is .
and it is that before a stroke was confined to a wheelchair in 2008 , he was engaged in sport for more than 60 years , as a player of minor categories , a player in the Choncese National High Representative in the BSN with the Swamion Goar or Chairman of the Federation of Balonry .
&quot; I put many hats on the quagmire through my life , including several of them , including several of them , as when he was President of the BSN , the manager of the National Movement and Federal Chairman during the 1990 &quot; s , &quot; he remembered for a visit from First Hora to his home in Koamon , where he lies with Elizabeth , his faithful wife , his faithful wife for more than 50 years .
&apos;That is my life &apos; .
they don &apos;t exaggerate in making that statement .
the walls of his home , almost all of which are packed with photos and memorable ideas that give up his broad track , testify to this .
Zurich in the Real
of all of us , the most emotive ones are the ones who remember their passage through the jeans since the mid @-@ 1950 &quot; s as a player up to 1982 , when it took 15 years to hang on its feet and take the place of the duty @-@ free .
&quot; these were my best years , I enjoyed the most , because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships since 1967 , whether they take hold , co @-@ take or leader .
it was a lot of years of satisfaction , including five championships from 1971 to 1975 .
then I did not ask for one in the 1981 , the year of liberter of Jersey and in the BSN .
from then on , he took over the &quot; Cortiz , &quot; who was a great administrator , &quot; he indicated .
I recall the fact that Gene Bartow , who had led here and was at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said to me : &quot; I have a very strong player , of 6 &quot; 7 &quot; of stature .
do you want it ? &apos;
and that was the principle of Miny , one of the best players that Puerto Rico had .
Bartow then recommended the Franco @-@ style Raymond Gininon , who was naviy and was one of our best masters .
I recall that he said that if Mahay had given a championship to Koamon , Ginin would help bring another .
the jeans of the jeans was awarded , but already by distance , because it was now a federal power station in 1988 .
in that time , he preferred to enjoy his execution and those in the National Team .
I remember when we gained for the first time the United States during the Olympic TPP in Mexico in 1989 .
then came the World Cup in 1990 , where there was a fourth place , and it would have had to go out of no way by that Canadian referee who reminded us of the final game for the second time , he said &apos; .
is it the 1990 &quot; s group that is the best National team that they have seen ?
it is among the best , the same as the one who won him on the Wam TTM in the 2004 Olympics .
but my favourite was that of the Pan @-@ American in Cuba in 1991 , when we won gold and put it to the US team , which was fairly similar to the one that won us the 11th world @-@ wide .
that team did not only repeat Masiny , Ginin, Ramon Riva , Fico López and &quot; Pioin &quot; ( Ortiz ) , but also had a lot of ( Mr Solana ) and James Carter , the brothers Brittan ( Francis and Edar ) and Mario &quot; Quixote ) and Mario &quot; Quixote &quot; , who had not been able to stay in the 1990 &quot; s .
a team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff , but it gave us a gold pot and great joy was that of the 1995 TPP in Neuqut , Argentina .
with role players such as &quot; Chaanto &quot; Nack , Paul Aliyev , and a young girl by passing on the replacement of the players suspended by the monastery of the Pan @-@ American Sea Sea , we earn gold against all forecasts .
what has Puerto Rico &apos;s best player ?
of course , that has been Piñera .
their numbers at the level of international adventures are impressive .
no one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as he did .
and that does not count on his track record in the different leagues that he played .
who has been the best leader ?
that is very difficult .
we have had a very good camp which includes in July Tgold , For Melop , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dalmau , Armanto Torres .
of the young , I very much like the work of Leo Ariane .
how do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation ?
this was part of the most glorious National team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s he had up to 17 teams in a season .
what has been left to do ?
there were things that it would have wished to implement , such as the regionalisation of the minor categories .
for example , the N11 boys only spoke in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in national players .
at the same time , children travel and play too much unnecessarily .
at least , I see the fruit of compulsion and course for leaders , table officials .
I am pleased about that .
what do you do now ?
the most that I am doing is to listen to music , to watch the music videos of my time on YouTube , I enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time to go to poker games .
of course , I should like to enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .

&apos;Larry was back in his beloved home town , once again representing the odoic role that he most liked , &quot; said the family .
the family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dwalls to the blue @-@ Day Day of gratitude .
he is giving the floor , and he interpreted the role of his wife in the original number and the aftermath , he was with Pinman when he died in a Dorist hospital , he said the advertisers of it , Jeffrey Lane .
I was very pleased to hear what I knew .
it was creative , generous , amusing , amusing , friendly and talented , and I will be surprised by this .
&quot; he was an original person and experienced the life of the maximum , &quot; he claimed , and in a communiqué .
the liver was diagnosed with the liver in 1992 and recognized that he had gone a long way for years .
in 1995 , the liver was found in the liver and it was subjected to a transplant .
years ahead of &quot; Dwalls , &quot; Hagman made famous on television as a decent kind in the light poker &quot; I Tram from Sheikh &quot; , distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970 .
in it he interpreted the captain Tony Nelson , an astronaut whose life is disrupted when he finds an attractive genius , interpreted by Barbara Eden , and taken to live with him at his home .
it was also a major player , a short time for the air , &quot; The Good Life &quot; ( NBC , 1971 @-@ 72 ) and &quot; here We Gingin &quot; ( ABC , 1973 ) .
his work on the cinema included well @-@ welcomed papers for the criticism in &quot; The Group &quot; , &quot; Harry and Tay &quot; and &quot; First Colors . &quot;
but he was his master in the interpretation of the charming abhorrent JRel , which led the Perman to his peak depression .
the dramatic number of the CBS chain over the Ewing and other characters in its orbit came to the air from April 1978 to May 1991 .
the promotional phrase &quot; Who shot J.R. &quot; designed to generate expectations for a full @-@ minded episode in which the Mman &apos;s character is almost assassinated , led to international speculation and millions of risky dollars in betting houses .
he also helped give him a record at that time .
when the answer was revealed in a chapter of November 1980 , an average of 41 million TV screens in the past was shaped and turned to &quot; Dwalls &quot; in the second most apparent entertainment program in history , behind the end of &quot; Mash &quot; in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
he was the person of J.Rin ( interpreted by Mary Croby ) who has shot him .
in the opinion of the Commission , it was the case that the death penalty was thrown out and then threatened with the name of a prostitute , unless it was outside the city , but others also had reason to attack it .
Perman interpreted Ewing as a corrupt corrupt with a charismatic smile : a toritup entrepreneur and a unfaithful husband who tried his alcohol wife , Sue Elen ( Linda Graz ) , to be at odds .
&quot; I know what I would like to do in the Jticall of JR , &quot; he said Corman in 1988 .
he should say : &quot; this is the honest citizen J.Re . &quot;
this is the only one negotiated that he lost .
a CEO of the original number , reminded on Friday of the Mman as someone &quot; enormous , both inside and out of the screen . &quot;
it is incredible , and irreplaceable , for millions of fans in the world , and in the hearts of each of us , that we were fortunate to know and love it .
ten episodes of the new &quot; Dwalls &quot; edition were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the SCAF channel .
it had already completed five of the chapters for the second season and one sixth was in the process , reported the chain .
there was immediately no statement from Warner or from the drachma about how the number of Levi &apos;s loss will be handled .
he was a son of the Truth and singer Mary Martin , who was the son of the Perifth and singer Mary Martin , who boasted classical works such as &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; Peter Pan . &quot;
Martin was still a teenager when he held it in 1931 during his marriage with the lawyer Ben Corman .
he was fortunate in New York &apos;s performance scenarios at the beginning of the 1950 &quot; s , then served at the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England .
as long as he was there I met the young Swedish designer Maj Axeneny and married with her .
the couple had two children , Prodon and Patrii , and lived for a long time in the California city of Mali , where many welcome lie .
in 2001 , his memoirs &quot; Hthis Darlin &apos;s : Tall ( and Abfix Te ) Tens &quot; Se &quot; The &quot; have been used for the sake of &quot; Hthe Darlin . &quot;
&quot; I did not say there that I believed that someone would be at the end of the street or affected , &quot; he told the Press that was associated with him at that time .
after the liver transplant , he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as voluntary in a hospital to assist fearful patients .
&quot; I would advise them , I give you courage , I meet them when they come for their sports and then , &quot; he indicated in 1996 .
trying to offer some comfort , as &quot; don &apos;t fear , will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but they will be well . &quot;
he was also an activist against smoking and took part in a number of campaigns .
the &quot; Fin in the World &quot; Now is a course of action .
every week , students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war , zombie , viruses , and global warming .
this six @-@ month term , when the professor in religion Stuart Charé decided to conduct a course on the end of the world , knew that he had an irresistible hand @-@ off : the end of the &quot; long @-@ term &quot; climate &quot; of Calendo Maya , on 21 December , which many people have held up as proof that the end of the world has come to fruition .
but Charé had no idea what he hoped for in the next couple of months : the tumultuous hurricane Sandy , a fiscal cliff that some have called &quot; bloated debt &quot; and a growing conflict that involves Israel , the place where Christian theorists of the end believe the support will begin .
&quot; I did not realise that this was going to be the most apocalyptic six @-@ month six , &quot; he said this week to students from the Russian University University ( New Jersey ) .
if you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting , that was a really good time .
and remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality .
and he is not just a professor who offers courses about &quot; the end of the world &quot; this six @-@ month term , in theory the last of history .
in the storm , the deputy professor , Barar Barie , is taking away the course , &quot; Media , Culture , and the end of the world . &quot;
every week , students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war , zombie , viruses , and global warming .
&quot; we are looking at why these ideas grow over time , &quot; he said , and the way in which he offers hypothetical scenarios that guide some human behavior .
if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could erupt .
this month , students analyzed films with apocalyptic issues and explored how they compare with examples of real life .
&quot; I have tried to inform students about what is possible , likely , credible , and impossible , &quot; he said .
in the main player at the State University of Pennsylvania , the history professor in Latin America Kamw Rburst and his colleague Aong Solari , a deputy teacher from the Arte and anthropoanthropoology , has made a team to provide a course , entitled &apos; The end of the world &apos; .
&quot; we do not add &quot; 2012 &quot; to always have the option of carrying out the course again , if the world does not end , &quot; said Rburst .
despite the &quot; imminent ruin , &quot; students must study , generate projects , and take final exams .
in Penn State , the final examination will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse , which leaves students no option but to work &quot; until the same night that the world is supposed to end , &quot; said Rash .
the courses were quite popular .
&quot; it was saturated in two hours , &quot; he said Rash l about his course for high @-@ average students , who filled with 35 students .
we received messages by e @-@ mail for weeks and weeks before the start of the six months , of people asking if there was still a place .
students , for their part , claim that the course is one of the most interesting .
&quot; I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves , &quot; he said Bridgd Robinson , a student of the 23 @-@ year @-@ old prison in HADEP , New Jersey , in Rutders @-@ Camden .
the apocalyptic mentality , secular or religious , is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it .
Wikel , a student in the race for Psiology and the manhausa , 25 @-@ year @-@ old race , said that he had seen all apocalyptic films .
&quot; never heard about a class that could teach that &quot; , he indicated .
I enjoy it .
but no student interviewed - and much less a professor - said to believe in the expiry date of 21 December .
&quot; our first project dealt with the full and somehow discrediting , &quot; said Julie Zegen , a student of last year in the storms of 21 years and West Chester .
the lion had never predicted the end of the world ; it was only a key point in the timetable , he said Rash .
but he was bound to have an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture , dating back to several centuries , in which people react to changes to their around pre @-@ the end of the world .
the Internet has caused a rise in this speculation .
&quot; elsewhere , people do not think about this , &quot; he said .
they are mostly in the English @-@ speaking world .
Joseph Fogh University , a professor of religion by the University La Salda who provides courses in the Philippines this year , quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about a course about the &quot; end of the world &quot; there .
&quot; the Philippines does not take part in the end of the world , &quot; he wrote , implying an exception of a higher authority .
we have a pardon from the Pope .
it was noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final trial , and he said that if nothing happens on 21 December , &apos; people will start to think immediately of the next date &apos; or to the philosophers that on 21 December is the start of a seven @-@ year period after the end of the world .
students and teachers are taking the date lightly .
a number of people said that they want to go to Moscow &quot; at the end of the world . &quot;
&quot; he may call some friends to together , &quot; Mr Ford commented on , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old communications student .
