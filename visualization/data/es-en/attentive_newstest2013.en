a Republican Strategy to stand up for Obama 's re - election
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud .
however , the Brenner centre sees this last a myth and states that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die as a result of the fall of a ray .
indeed , Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in ten years .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation .
in this respect , these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system .
contrary to what is happening in Canada , American states are responsible for the US federal election organization .
along the lines of a majority of American governments , they issued new laws that made the registration or voting process more difficult by a majority of American governments .
this phenomenon has been extended after the November 2010 elections , which saw the increase of 6@@ 75 Republican new Republican representatives in 26 states .
as a result , 180 law projects that restricted the exercise of voting rights in 41 states were introduced during 2011 .
the new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph , as well as a test of American citizenship .
on the other hand , these laws reduce the early voting periods , override the right to register as voter on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with criminal records .
before the 2006 elections , no American state required voters to present an identity document with photograph .
the State of Emergency was the first to demand it .
the United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Emergency .
that is why Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states .
in the last few years these authorities have supported law projects in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with photograph .
it is important to bear in mind that , contrary to what happens in Q@@ é@@ ec , American citizens do not have a universal identity document , such as the Social Security Card .
in fact , 11 % of American citizens , in other words 21 million people of voting age , have no identity cards with photograph issued by a government agency of their state .
on the other hand , five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics .
but , often , obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars .
thus the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people , minorities , and low @-@ income people .
indeed , 25 % African Africans , 15 % of people earning less than $ 35 000 a year , 18 % of the citizens of over 65 and 20 % of voters aged between 18 and 29 , do not have an identity card with photograph .
and there is more .
in many states , the students , the voters who most vote for the Democratic candidates , cannot use the identity card with photograph issued by their institution .
on the other hand , these same states authorise members of the fishing clubs or hunting that often vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs .
before 2004 , no state called for the evidence of citizenship to vote .
Arizona was the first state to put forward such a demand .
since 2011 , a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to show that they are American citizens .
these measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote .
it appears that two out of every three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party .
on the other hand , Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of eight @-@ state scrutiny .
moreover , they limited the right of individuals and groups to create an aid service to the voters who would like to register .
these restrictions have consequences .
for example , in the general election in 2004 , voter registration campaigns contributed to the register of around 10 million citizens .
the measures taken since 2009 have achieved the rate of registration of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006 .
moreover , Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored a reduction in advance voting period .
for example , in the 2008 elections in Florida , 33 % of voters who voted in advance were African @-@ Americans , while the latter accounted for more than 13 % of the state &apos;s voters .
in the case of Spain , exactly the same thing was happening .
these represent only 11 % of the electorate , which amounts to 24 % of the citizens who vote in advance .
however , targets , which represent 76 % of the electorate , represent no more than 46 % of citizens who vote in advance .
of course , the Democratic legislators and their supporters have opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the register of voters .
in this respect , the Democratic governors have blocked a number of legislative projects .
the US Public Prosecutor intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
it was partly possible to limit the damage .
for example , only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring an identity document with photograph .
however , it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012 .
the critical democrats denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted for , since it is clear that the intention is to influence the results of 2012 in the key states .
a report by the Brenner Center in 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to get the presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election in 2012 .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation .
in this respect , the measures will undermine the American democratic system .
the detection of prostate cancer : do we test the test or do not do it ?
indeed , the P@@ SA test sometimes presents wrong results , with false negative results or even false positive results , after which useless medical interventions are decided .
it is more than sufficient reason to doubt the already reluctant men on whether or not testing tests should be carried out .
the test or not ?
we requested advice from two specialists .
in the studies carried out in the United States , a large index of infection was detected between the groups of evidence , so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations .
for its part , the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among patients who had carried out the detection and those who did not .
the study , following a 12 @-@ year follow @-@ up , also showed that there is between 30 and 40 % of possibilities of suffering metal if the detection test has not been carried out .
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 , or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer .
African @-@ American men have a higher risk rate .
the key is to take a good decision once cancer is detected .
there are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are elusive .
we need to ensure that the patient understands the level of risk of cancer , and it must be given every possible choice and not necessarily to deal with the long @-@ term cancers that do not affect life in the long term , in which case , rather than being active in the active disease , it should be chosen .
today many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated , since such cancer is not aggressive and poses a risk to their lives .
instead , we suggest active monitoring of the disease and , if this progress is progressing , we offer them a treatment .
we are increasingly demanding precise criteria for deciding who should or is not to be treated .
I recommend that the test be made in any case .
but it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be made .
the International Society of Ur@@ ology has created a tool in cooperation with the International Society of Ur@@ ology , which allows for an assessment of the pros and cons of the P@@ SA test .
this document can be discharged ( for the time being only in English , but it will be offered in a little ) in the next direction : in the next direction : - / / / / / FR / FR / the @-@ health @-@ screening @-@ management paper .
preventing the Disease
unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for cancer prevention .
despite the progress of investigations , healthy living habits remain the best way to reduce the risks of disease .
we think that if everyone in the world was good and moved , 30 % of the cancers could be prevented .
&quot; if no one would smoke , this rate would rise , at least , to 50 % , &quot; emphasizes André S@@ li@@ ad@@ u , the spokesperson for the Can@@ e@@ a Society against Cancer .
instead , we assess that about 10 % of cancers are hereditary .
many others remain utterly inexplicable .
the fight against smoking is still a priority , despite the reduction in the number of smokers , for the Can@@ e@@ Cancer Society against Cancer .
tobacco is linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
it is also a risk factor for other types of cancers .
it is very damaging to people &apos;s health .
&quot; today , there are still 1.5 million smokers in Q@@ é@@ é@@ ec , &quot; declared the spokesman André Bal@@ li@@ .eu .
a hopeful fact : 10 years after it stopped smoking , the risk of dying of cancer is halved .
the peso
g@@ ord@@ a and obesity also favor the appearance of the disease , according to SCAF .
they increase the risks of breast cancer , of me@@ n , and of p@@ oc@@ ag@@ , of p@@ ag@@ ag@@ as and the u@@ u@@ ans .
&quot; research shows that the regular practice of physical activity for all lives protects breast cancer , &quot; add .
nutrition
the body also recommends limiting the use of red meat .
in large quantities , they make the risks of malicious cancer the risk of suffering .
chat products must also be avoided .
the preservation of meat in the run @-@ up to it , which is dry or , can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances .
&quot; they can damage the body &apos;s cells and lead to cancer development , &quot; they explain .
vitamins
in recent years , several scientists have studied links between vitamin complex and cancer .
for the time being , however , their investigations are not conclusive .
Se@@ u the SCAF , the studies on vitamin E are contradictory .
whereas in one of them was a decline in prostate cancer risks , in another what was observed , rather , was an increase .
the effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly defined .
on the other hand , Mr Funke insists on the importance of speaking about the concerns and family records of each with his doctor .
&apos;@@ making the screening test does not cause cancer . &apos;
the J@@ ion of H@@ gs in detail
the announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs J@@ gs was a great shock last summer , and rightly so .
it is , in fact , believed that this jungle is a partner of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe , nothing more and nothing less .
what is more , it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model : our best or &quot; less bad &quot; explanation of nature and the behavior of the matter , which has not yet been detected empirical .
but for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is a matter of en@@ gs .
we clearly know that there is a new particle , and that it seems to have a great deal to do with the J@@ ion of the the standard model , predicted by the standard model .
moreover , new data revealed this week at a major municipal congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is , even though more data is still lacking in order to be completely safe .
in any case , we assume that it is a matter of the carriers , since the chances of being wrong are few , and we will see what this is about .
there is , in this great world , a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time .
there is no way to violate that rule and do not try too much , because it will end up being damaged .
although the physics of particulates is a very complex world , it has been shown that there is a law of this kind as well : the exclusion principle of P@@ li , which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot; quantum state &quot; ; a &quot; state &quot; that is largely of some of its characteristics .
physicists classify particles in two categories .
on the one hand , we find ourselves in a situation where we have the good people who are called &apos; fair &apos; , who wisely obey the principle of P@@ li .
and , on the other hand , there are the forests , a dirty p@@ al@@ d@@ y@@ y@@ ist who has no respect for anything , or at least not for this principle , which means that they can find themselves in the same place and at the same time .
according to the in the case ( the ) According to The &apos; Made in the work of Berkeley &apos; , which is extraordinary , the forests are divided into two groups : the hills , of which we will not talk here , and the &apos; particles of force &apos; , whereby the large forces of nature are spreading and with which the J@@ ion of the H@@ ars would be somehow related .
these forests , you would like to stress here , are not the exotic bi@@ li@@ ousness that we could believe .
indeed , if he succeeds in reading this chronic forest , it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal forest : the photographer or the &quot; light particle &quot; acting as a &quot; messenger &quot; of electromagnetic power .
indeed , when a particle with an electrical burden accelerates or changes direction , it &quot; dis@@ orders &quot; the electromagnetic field in that precise environment ; a little like when we launched a stone to a standstill .
in this &quot; disorder &quot; is an electromagnetic wave ( from the light , from the ultra @-@ ins , etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a statue , that is to say , one of the Bosnian bodies .
more stable field
the same is true of the J@@ ion of the H@@ ars , with the difference that it is a different area , the field of Higgs , which needs to be &quot; disorderly &quot; to make this Bosnian appearance .
however , the field of carriers is far more stable than the electromagnetic field ; in order to activate it , it is necessary to arrive at extremely high energy sources , a little like this as a quagmire in which only a big rock can slide into the surface .
that is why we need an immense accelerator of particles like that of CER@@ N ( the big ho@@ ist of h@@ li@@ der is a 2@@ 27 km ring ! ) to achieve such energy levels .
the analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the top and the mass .
indeed , not all particles and all materials interact with the electromagnetic field .
some , such as magnets , do so , but others do not : a piece of paper , for example , not ever to be left to the door of a mess .
in the same way , all particles interact with the countryside : those who do so have a mass , while the rest ( how the statue , by the way ) , does not have it .
but what &quot; can they bring &quot; all these research , &quot; Mrs P@@ am@@ on@@ don .
for science , this serves to verify the validity of the standard model ( MS ) , and it also allows physicists to examine the differences between the observations and predictions of the MS .
for their part , many of them very much want to find themselves , for the smallest difference could open the door to a &quot; new physics &quot; to plug certain holes in the model .
it has to be said that this is still a huge deficit , as it does not propose any explanation of the gravity of the matter , or to the dark matter , which makes up about 80 % of the world of the universities ( other people ) .
but we have not found such differences in CER@@ N so far .
impact
the impact of such investigations on our day is difficult to predict , but we do not believe that we are wrong by saying that it will not have any .
to see it : in the early 1960 &quot; s , the pioneers in laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would lead to .
they saw the scientific applications , but nothing else .
indeed , as the physicist Wil@@ ard Bo@@ mer , who worked on the Bel@@ l laboratories , where the lens was invented in 1960 , and which drew up the first , continued persistence ( the first were pressed ) in 1962 , the ring was rather considered to be a &quot; laboratory apparatus . &quot;
imagine ...
furthermore , the applications can also come from all the tools surrounding research .
for example , the same Wil@@ ard Bo@@ yle produced a light c@@ as@@ er in 1969 in the course of its optical research .
despite the fact that it was not his original intention at all , this bon@@ ator now serves to &quot; eye &quot; for all digital appliances in the world , which was the Nobel Nobel Prize in 2009 .
that does not mean , of course , that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C will necessarily want to transform our lives , but that they never know ...
palliative care : the best way to die ... A4 @-@ 4@@ 4@@ ;
in his Commission , Mor@@ r in dignity , Q@@ é@@ é@@ ec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life .
the debate must be taken soon while a draft law is being prepared .
however , in this essential domain , there is still a lot to be done .
he has tried to see him closely .
just a few weeks ago , Mr Lomas was only in his own home apartment in the Mon@@ ir@@ im@@ ma .
prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two @-@ year respite .
&quot; I had been given five years of life , but I have already had seven years of life , &quot; ata , in fact , lying in his bed at the Victor @-@ G@@ er@@ bo@@ is of Bel@@ o@@ k , to which he arrived the previous day .
&quot; but it is always a shock , we cannot be prepared for this , &quot; it continues .
the disease has caused havoc : a huge weakness that prevents it from going only to bathing and even eating on its own .
sitting on lunch , he accepts resigned to eating .
courage , even smile , to talk to the unknown people who devote it to him , bring drugs and give him a bath water .
the courage of ordinary death .
&quot; my greatest wish is that I cure the diarrhea , it is humiliating , &quot; he trusted .
a few hours later , the team found a cure to that evil .
&quot; in the course of our lives , we learn that a man makes a &quot; ordinary old man &quot; - Pierre Bro@@ de@@ ur , a psychologist at the Victor @-@ G@@ bo@@ is centre .
to return to children , to some people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
&quot; that depends on the person &apos;s ability to accept this regression , &quot; he notes .
because , according to the majority of people working in palliative care , the big moment takes place at the very heart of that regression .
all patients entering the palliative care center Victor @-@ G@@ y@@ is suffer from cancer .
they have a three @-@ month ceiling of life .
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide &quot; cure . &quot;
the greatest fear of Mrs A. , of 89 years , is to die &apos; conscious and drowning &apos; .
but the disease has made them discover their children .
&quot; I have good children , &quot; he adds .
&quot; I do not have any more wishes in this life , &quot; he says , before accepting that he should be put on a charity to help her to breathe .
and it is waiting , in the next few days , for a last visit from your child living in Italy .
a group of volunteers , a group of volunteers , is being provided with a group of volunteers and food aid .
they are palliative care that they are given when nothing can be done more .
to help her death be more comfortable .
in Q@@ é@@ m we have a palliative care bed for every 11.@@ 700 inhabitants .
it is very little , as we know that we will all end up dying one day .
here , life is continuing under the best possible conditions , explaining the D@@ ick@@ a Mar@@ ane Mar@@ el , one of the center &apos;s masters .
whether it be at the level of physical comfort , emotional or spiritual .
dying in dying is being put out in the mouths of br@@ dy or P@@ ep@@ si , according to demand .
diabetics are no longer monitored their sugar rate .
death is part of the day .
yesterday evening we served a beer for Mr X , who died in the course of the night .
this morning , his son ended up the beer at the late .
&quot; we help patients as well as their loved ones , &quot; m@@ at@@ ata N@@ o@@ ali@@ e Sav@@ ard , the head of the care .
at the center Victor @-@ G@@ bo@@ is days , they have never been the same .
on the side of a 94 @-@ year @-@ old man who has known his last family meeting in the garden , well placed among his al@@ li@@ ch in the face of his health , a 36 @-@ year @-@ old young man dies tragically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and two children , having tried everything to survive .
&quot; for six months , there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who have been cancer .
53 % of patients who are admitted to the Victor @-@ G@@ gh@@ is@@ en centre come from home and 47 % of the hospital .
the question of access to palliative care
77 % of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care , that is to say , care designed to relieve suffering when an ill reaches the terminal &apos;s terminal of their lives , be they home , in hospital or in a care centre .
and several bodies , such as the Victor @-@ G@@ bo@@ is and the home @-@ home care society of the Grand Mon@@ li@@ al , are specified almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients .
it is precisely that great lack of health care in Q@@ é@@ ec , which makes many specialised doctors in palliative care fear the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide .
since October , a manifesto signed by an expert of palliative care , such as Dr Bal@@ four , and Dr Bernard Lenarčič , are circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
according to the D@@ ra@@ en Mar@@ ella Mar@@ el , Q@@ é@@ ec &apos;s health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to high @-@ quality palliative care before it is accepted with euthanasia .
&quot; recently , &quot; G@@ ata , &quot; I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Ur@@ ach@@ ways suffering from great pain without any need to alleviate it .
I fear that patients wish to die only because they do not receive adequate care . &quot;
and at the same time , many onco@@ logists persist with their patients until the last day , despite the worst forecasts .
Hélène Richard &apos;s hopes for survival were already low when he left a exhausting chemotherapy treatment .
&quot; when I said to my colleague , who wanted to stop treatment , she told me that she was very sorry that I would like to stop fighting .
I had said , however , that there was nothing else to do ! &quot;
there is no all @-@ powerful care
the D@@ ra@@ el believes that 90 % of the patients who seek to die welcome to their carers who have not met them in their demands once they have been relieved of pain thanks to a team of palliative care .
but it has to be said that palliative care is not absolutely all @-@ powerful as far as the treatment of pain is concerned .
according to El@@ si@@ y Mon@@ er@@ au , the head of the home @-@ house care manager , patients do not respond to treatments against pain in 8 % of cases .
at the end of life , doctors tend to resort to the palliative , which serves to sleep the patient up to the moment of their death , whether in a sporadic or permanent way .
we cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering .
more and more , the disease will not alleviate the possibility of having such a palliative .
the patients who are not relieved are all saying the same : &apos; I want to die &apos; .
but that does not necessarily mean &apos; I want euthanasia &apos; , but &apos; I want to relieve me &apos; .
the execution of this report has been possible thanks to a grant of journalism from Canada &apos;s health research institutes .
large @-@ scale real @-@ estate scandals in Q@@ é@@ ec
road officials , B@@ TP &apos;s employers , money @-@ sharing officials , and Italian mafia specialists count , day after day , for what they know about a formidable &quot; system , &quot; from which the construction industry , officials , politicians , trade unionists , and mafia , form part .
an &quot; industry &quot; that came too expensive for tax payers , especially in the 1990 &quot; s and 2000 &quot; s .
&quot; it is curious how the system has been decimated once we have caught the big media , &quot; Mr Jacques Du@@ ch@@ ne@@ au , a Member of the former Academy of Police in Montreal .
he led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011 , which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into the misappropriation of road contracts in Q@@ é@@ ec , that the liberal Prime Minister of that moment , Jean Char@@ est , had no more sense than to delay .
the Du@@ ch@@ ne@@ au report established a direct link between industry , the clandestine financing of parties , and corruption among officials .
&quot; since the start of the research in 2010 , only the transport ministry would have saved $ 1 billion in contracts , &quot; containing some of its instincts to remain on a proportional basis .
the Com@@ bon@@ au Commission has already given two mayors , &quot; adds , while it hopes to be able to &quot; demonstrate the existing devices behind individuals . &quot;
permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , created in 2011
the permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , created in 2011 , applies also with its team of auditors , researchers , and government analysts .
this unit operates as well as the policemen of &quot; the te@@ ad@@ ra Mar@@ au , &quot; which , since 2009 , have made the Montreal &quot; cartel cartel &quot; moderate in pumping contracts .
in recent weeks , unity has been recording in a series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Z@@ ast@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ ä@@ te , the mayor of a city of the outskirts .
the next of the list would be Gilani &apos;s , who has just resigned from his post of Laval mayor , the third city of Q@@ é@@ ec .
there is a suspicion that there has been repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts .
it has been formally accused of the road engineers of Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs of origin such as Tony Action and L@@ ino Z@@ ag@@ to .
the latter has caused shock in explaining to the committee the mechanics of the &quot; system &quot; of public procurement .
for three years , he paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred money to Union Mon@@ ol@@ al , the party of the mayor , the Mayor Tr@@ ac@@ la@@ y .
M. Zīle distributed money at a right and sinister time during the years 2000 , giving more than $ 8@@ 8,000 Canadian dollars ( some EUR 6@@ 8,000 ) to provincial parties , especially the liberals in power .
he also admitted that he had organised a collection of illegal funds for the former liberal former deputy prime minister , N@@ at@@ ali@@ e Babitsky .
the cost of the cost of sewage contracts
in Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of corruption worked effectively .
Gilani &apos;s former public works engineer explained it to the committee : in ten years , he received gifts , travel invitations , golf rooms , restaurants , game @-@ loving parties , and bribes from business @-@ to @-@ construction companies to a total of $ 7@@ 3@@ 6,000 , in return for sewage contracts whose costs were inflated .
other road @-@ network officials have admitted that they received money to pump up invoices between 30 and 40 % in false overtime .
in addition , an organizing of the mayor &apos;s party , Martin Duhamel , charged M. Tr@@ ac@@ la@@ y , deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his own dirty money .
in the wake of these revelations , M. Tr@@ ac@@ la@@ y resigned at the beginning of November , and led to a huge crisis in Montreal .
Ch@@ i@@ al Rouhani was one of the first pre @-@ election policies in Montreal to sound the alarm .
as a mayor of the Long @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des Cities district in the east of the island , it has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of local @-@ land municipal land of $ 1.6 million to promoters in real @-@ estate boom .
it was dirty money that 70 % of the election campaigns were dirty money .
from the research that will finally be carried out , she ensures that it is thrown out &apos; of a thread so that it can understand the functioning of the system , infiltrated by dri@@ en , in order to stop it and fish the guilty . &apos;
it adds that the process is &apos; painful but positive &apos; .
we are cleaning the wounds , but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and to be very vigilant so that dubious practices are not repeated .
how to clean up .
on a regular basis .
Jacques Du@@ ch@@ ne@@ au , for his part , declares that &quot; officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars , &quot; but is worried about the role of &quot; elected politicians &quot; to the tide . &quot;
in fact , 70 % of the dirty money allocated to the financing of election campaigns in Q@@ é@@ ec , ironic , said : &apos; I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality . &apos;
the British @-@ style government proposes limiting donations to parties to 100 dollars , but that will not change the donation , according to it , &quot; while not strictly limiting electoral expenditures , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
it advocates a complete review of the system of public procurement and party financing : &apos; we cannot fall lower ; going to the bottom of things , with courage , will enable us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation , with more controls and laws &apos; .
if this story was to overturn the international image of Q@@ é@@ ec and Montreal , M. Du@@ ch@@ ne@@ au invites those who would look to the mirror .
&quot; the PS@@ G is not the Barcelona QE ! &quot;
this season has acquired a new entity with the PS@@ G .
how would this advance explain ?
it could be explained by an individual taking @-@ up , but also by the new size of the PS@@ G .
big players have arrived .
let us move on to its day @-@ to @-@ day day .
the technical staff have also given me a great deal .
these elements , on a daily basis , drive me to raise the level of my game .
in one party , that is easier .
it is all very fast in football .
but I am not going to sleep .
ever since I began at the IN@@ F C@@ la@@ z@@ on@@ z@@ on@@ ia centre to my step by Saint @-@ E@@ ti@@ ne , I have always moved forward by leaps and bounds .
it is going to gain the benefit of the competition recruited by Carlo An@@ am@@ otti .
the recruits of this summer are used to fighting very high @-@ level parties .
they know that every training is crucial .
that makes a player like me want to fight and do everything .
I am very much involved in my position , Mr Tomlinson , in relation to my position .
he is backed by the same position as Claude Ma@@ k@@ el@@ ar , who was in the same position as me .
is it the man who needed the team ?
of course .
Annapolis inspires respect for all the technicians .
today , there is no such thing as League 1 and it is among the best European coaches .
it has a great deal of experience and has gained many titles with the best clubs .
he has worked with large players .
I believe that there will be other titles in Paris .
I had a very reassuring discussion with him in January .
I had just come out of a number of injuries .
the confidence that you have in me also explains my good performance .
what do you think about the PS@@ G in the first part of the season ?
in the 1 , Lyon League , we have been taken away by the leader .
however , we are still in the sand .
one of our greatest objectives is the champions of the champions : we have classified ourselves with the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ end .
what is the aim of the club in this competition ?
we will try to get as far as possible .
from now on , anything can happen .
but we have a lot to say to many very good European teams .
we want , in the first place , to end the first of our league in the face of Port , in order to be able to get back from the end of the end .
can the PS@@ G be a great European club in the short term ?
it already has the budget ...
to become a great European club , Paris has to make securities and be there in the long term .
that is not the case today .
at an economic level , the PS@@ G is handed over to the means for this project to be implemented .
not winning the glass in League 1 , as in the last season , would it be a great failure ?
that would , of course , be a great disappointment .
this year we are going to invest all our efforts to take that title of champions .
we did not go far enough in the last season .
we were disappointed in May , because we had the right conditions for the first end .
we had a strong season .
we end up with 79 points .
normally , 79 points should have been champions ...
but another team , the Mont@@ mo@@ er , had a fairly better season .
this year I think it will be good .
even if large teams such as Marseilles , Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title , I think that we have the weapons to take it .
do you think the media expect more from the PS@@ G ?
it is normal for us to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have .
we have fully accepted that .
after we won 4 @-@ 0 in house to Trojan , who is still with things to reproach us , it is a bit frustrating .
we wonder what more people are waiting for .
we will never be able to win 4 @-@ 0 every weekend .
we are not the QE of Barcelona !
we are trying to put a project in place .
a team is constructed on time .
we have shown in the champions of champions that we can answer and be present .
look at the Manchester City , which , after two seasons , has not been able to qualify for final @-@ fashioned last @-@ minute , and they have also invested a great deal !
in view of the sums invested , we would imagine 15 points of advantage to the day .
that would be to neglect our opponents and the championship in France .
Lyon and Marseilles , which were not well in the previous season , have been &quot; driven &quot; by this new PS@@ G .
that shows that the League 1 is exciting .
I hope that , in May , we will be able to say with a smile that , despite all the difficulties , we have ended up taking the trophy .
the SP@@ G seems to be entirely dependent on Zidane &apos;s success stories .
better than let us say that we have a &apos; Z@@ U dependency &apos; .
that is to say that it is very competent and hard @-@ pressed .
he has come to prove that he is the League 1 star .
and he has shown in all the teams that he has gone through that he is a great player , a world star .
we in the group respect the man and the player .
and he also respects the men he has around him .
what he has done is truly exceptional .
that prompts others to raise their level of play .
T@@ shi@@ ago Silva , one of the best defenders of the world , also allows us all to make progress .
how did the Euro 2012 have lived with France &apos;s team ?
it was a disappointment .
I was very keen to take part in this Euro @-@ glass .
unfortunately , my injury prevented me from accumulating time .
I saw things there and were strengthened .
today , it is a good thing to play good parties in the selection .
that is what I was expecting from my b@@ id@@ ism to the &apos; le@@ us &apos; .
we learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine , and that is why today we have exemplary behaviour .
what vision do you have of the first month of D@@ ne@@ er Descartes at the front of the &apos; le@@ us &apos; ?
it is achieving results .
they are well placed in the league group for the World Cup .
the choice is rigorous , close to the players , and inspires to win .
like the Laurent Blanc case .
but I do not want to make comparisons .
the Mont Blanc tunnel achieved its aim of classifying us for the Euro @-@ 20 .
I hope that D@@ di@@ er Déby will lead to the selection of Brazil .
in Spain , of 16 October in Spain , is it meant to lay the foundations ?
that game gave us confidence .
everyone fought for everyone .
before that shock in Spain , I had not experienced a similar game in my career .
with B@@ it@@ co@@ in , paying and selling without banks
on the contrary to current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions , and the burden of prosecution between the parties .
moreover , as is often the case in technologies , political vision is palpable : the conviction that the current monetary system , consisting of bank monopolies , leads to financial crises .
indeed , B@@ it@@ co@@ in , invented by S@@ at@@ s@@ hi N@@ ak@@ am@@ oto , is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars , euros , and so on , and a safe exchange protocol to the B@@ it@@ T@@ ent &apos;s way , which allows for the exchange of equal file .
around 200 000 transactions have been recorded by 15 000 network computers .
and around a thousand websites accept the C@@ co@@ ins as donations or as a form of payment .
the stock of B@@ co@@ in , having reached the top of $ 30 ( EUR 23 ) in June 2011 , fell to $ 2 five months later , before coming back today to around $ 10 ( the contributions register on the page @-@ on @-@ page website ) .
it is nothing impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or in financial products .
yet the European Central Bank ( ECB ) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
it was described as B@@ co@@ in as &quot; the most successful virtual currency , &quot; &quot; which competes with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to conventional currencies . &quot;
it differs from other systems with rates of virtual currencies such as &quot; credits , &quot; used to make progress in a vivid game , and that can be won by playing or can be bought ( and sometimes even channelled ) .
the social network Facebook also developed this kind of system .
but in any exchange , a central authority controls and deals with changes .
with B@@ co@@ co@@ in , all the grid is at the same time that books of accounting , tests , issuers of currency and buyers and sellers are set at the same time .
how does this network work ?
every compromise between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of e @-@ mail .
a user can choose a different direction for each payment , thereby guaranteeing anonymity .
a set of information linked to this compromise is signed electronically through a double @-@ key encryption system .
the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction .
thanks to the content of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the changes in B@@ co@@ ins appear in the public accounts book , which is disseminated by the entire network .
the key milestone is to write this new transaction in that book .
this passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers and winner , a kind of temporary central banker , the privilege of adding that complementary line .
this is a stage of file @-@ breaking , that is to say , the transformation of a large file into a shorter and smaller numerical footprint .
the computers &quot; co@@ gene &quot; the new transaction and add a number before &quot; tr@@ ing &quot; the whole .
the aim is to find the number that offers a particular footprint ( plus at the beginning ) .
once that number is found , the other no@@ two verify easily that it is the good .
the compromise then finds itself bound to be bound up with the chain of other transactions ; any amendment would change the mark .
if , in order to commit fraud , a user would like to pay twice with the same money , in less than ten minutes ) , the network would only accept one of the two transactions ; the other would be orphan , since both of them have different fingerprints .
the computer that resolves the challenge has been allowed to be 50 B@@ co@@ ins .
to avoid inflation , this reward is divided on two regularly , with probability before the end of 2012 .
the number of T@@ co@@ ins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are visible to the explanatory statement , leaving a broad margin .
the difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in the engine power .
the life of the network already has its ups and downs .
Web sites offering services for B@@ it@@ co@@ in have been attacked and cooked @-@ ins have been stolen in deposit .
&quot; the failure used does not affect the same protocol , &quot; it ensures Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , who has just launched C@@ mi@@ um , a real currency payment company using the B@@ it@@ co@@ in .
the ECB also takes account of the power stations to be fired thanks to the anonymous service .
but cash in cash presents the same defect .
actors of weight like Wikipedia &quot; s are rejecting payments of this kind .
others , like the W@@ ord@@ table platform , accept them .
recently , A@@ di Sher@@ t and D@@ ori@@ t R@@ on , the In@@ siege We@@ iz@@ mann in Israel , analysed the book of accounting , and showed that nearly 80 % of B@@ co@@ ins are not circulating .
in November , &quot; giant cuts &quot; were launched .
&quot; they have changed $ 30 000 , &quot; J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ al@@ st , who works for Co@@ in@@ és , which makes the C@@ co@@ ins in gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , the author of an educational book on this currency , believes quite a lot in the potential of this technology as well as on the transaction network .
his system , C@@ t@@ ut@@ ia , amounts to a credit card ( in real currency ) or to payment by mobile mobile phone , but uses B@@ it@@ co@@ in to validate transactions , which will make it cheaper .
the bearer , moreover , manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous .
the system is easy to put in place in the shops , which must not have to install new terminals or plunder .
it is enough to provide a direction that a telephone can &quot; preach and recognise , &quot; accurate , Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , which ensures thousands of users .
there is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems .
&quot; it will take a time for Breivik to impose , but in 2013 , there could be a change , &quot; he predicts .
in addition , the ECB &apos;s report provides for the assessment of the various risks that are currently being regarded as high , if this currency is to be successful .
we have come from Afghanistan .
and then ?
the French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( K@@ hi@@ sa and Sur@@ bi ) .
NATO and the Americans must come out at the end of 2014 .
it is time for the Afghan army to return to its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future , without waiting for us .
we have mainly punished Afghan farmers , whom we have considered terrorists .
and we ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , more injured and mutilated .
the Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads of refugees in Pakistan , but often also with peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army , as in the Soviet times .
they want to defend their ancient , archaic traditions , even if their causes are joined by the jihadists , the Pakistanis , the Arabs , the Uzbek men , or the ser@@ ik@@ os .
they , sometimes even aided by local insurgents , will no longer be able to do so when Westerners become more discreet .
the departure of the French troops on the basis of N@@ j@@ r@@ ab , which I observed from the top of the hills planted with the French funds , was done in order .
lorries and tanks were returned to Kabul without any attack , monitored by helicopters .
there will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014 .
the circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996 .
Kabul was then empty and the country engaged in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions .
his grip on the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation , a return to security .
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their Al @-@ Qaeda @-@ based peasants , but their situation is not better today .
the old mullahs , the current government , and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position .
the leading personalities of the anti @-@ Soviet war returned to power in 2001 .
they have become speculators , gaining government land to re@@ sell them as solar for the refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from huge US contracts of outsourcing .
they are discredited ; most of them have not fought .
people , as I have heard in the field , aspire to a government that does not consist of thieves .
many young people want to leave , as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity : the capital flight is considerable .
the young are tired of war and their ideologies .
they have lived through the modern world during their expulsion in Iran or Pakistan , and they have appreciated their advantages .
with about 65 % of their population under 25 years old , Kabul now account for 5 million inhabitants , one @-@ fifth of the total population .
in cities , state schools are full of girls and children alike .
those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties and the corruption of certain leaders will have to be given work .
all of us , including the armed opposition , are eager for mobile phones , with the Turkish riots that a modern world presents with great fans across the country .
the army is now present .
will the authorities that they want to run the country be considered legitimate ?
the former commanders of the anti @-@ Soviet struggle are already worried about re @-@ establishing provincial militias , which will flee from central power .
Afghanistan , mountains , strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation to the image of Western nations , yet the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state , with a strong presidential power , removing the post of the prime minister from the 1964 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want foreign control , in particular at the election planned in April 2014 .
yet your country is dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before .
no industry has re @-@ established its services , no packaging has been put in place and major irrigation systems have not been repaired .
everything is imported and nothing except fruit and vegetables is produced .
the priority is left to private initiative .
in a country ruined after 30 years of war , government control would have been necessary .
the rumour that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth expanded .
and that only increases the sentiment that Westerners were there to seize them .
without energy to extract the iron and copper ore from the land and without the means of transport to export them through the mountains , there is no mining .
the Chinese have already almost abandoned the M@@ en copper mines , leaving international archaeological ( funded by the World Bank ) view the vast relative location and stay there as the province &apos;s most important employers .
it will also require Afghanistan and Pakistan , a country from which imports and exports largely depend , to restore their normal relations .
the French troops took place on 20 November .
the new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid : schools of girls , schools of children , a French department at university , the French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , health and agricultural areas and support for the archaeological delegation .
since 2009 , with the aim of trying to &quot; win hearts and spirits , &quot; and to make the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions coincide , a &quot; civil and military action &quot; service of the Defense Ministry , abolished in 2012 , and made numerous French work of collective interest and rehabilitation actions in tens of mountain towns .
these work , which has led to local labour , has been able to help contain the insurrection : irrigation , wells , drinking water , reforestation , fruit trees , solar protection and growing farmland .
what will we remind ourselves of two million euros of military expenditure ?
a rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions , very hard in these valleys often more than 2,000 metres of height .
the Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals carried out by local communities in the Province of Kat@@ sa .
in order for them to be released from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups , something that farmers have told me that they want , it would be necessary to maintain a small , well @-@ controlled civil aid and to reach them directly .
a Constitution in Egypt
it is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi .
while Egypt is more divided than ever in the constitutional declaration , which gives it provisionally full powers , it decided to play the whole .
he took everyone by surprise on Wednesday , when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the next day .
only a week ago , the head of state had given the House two months to finish its work .
and almost two years ago , Egypt is using an interim text , several times as amended , weakening institutional stability and bringing justice to justice .
this new initiative has only increased the divide in the country .
for his opponents , the president is severe in his &quot; autocratic delusion , &quot; and he continues to &quot; betray his word , &quot; and &quot; trampling the right . &quot;
from its supporters , it ensures that it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process .
in the next 15 days , a referendum should be organised .
a very short period of time in which the Brothers are forced to give up their project of explaining the text , Article by article , to the Egyptians .
for the President , it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy as long as the controversy is raging across the country .
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for him , as he said in an interview with the American weekly weekly .
in view of the fact that this resource has been voted very quickly , it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people : &apos; or vote in my text or I maintain the full powers &apos; , powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution .
it is in this strange environment that 85 members of this constitutional assembly , a large majority , voted the text yesterday .
the majority of Liberals did not attend the call .
in mid @-@ November , a little before the constitutional declaration , they had closed the door because they estimated that they could not assert their views .
representatives of human rights , religious minorities and civil society did the same .
in order for the necessary quorum to be achieved , 11 people were added yesterday morning , a substitute for a hurry .
some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood .
as one might expect , the articles voted for were unanimous .
commentators make a grace , on the other hand , that one of the few differences in the day was expressed practically at the time of the sentence , so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the revolution &apos;s clock was wrong .
the text , which was still in the vote yesterday evening , consists of 2@@ 34 articles .
Article 2 , which is the subject of all eyes , is ultimately identical to the 1971 Constitution , which states that &apos; Sharia principles are the main source of the right &apos; .
the Salaf@@ ist parties , for whom the establishment of Islamic law are a fundamental claim , expected that &quot; the principles &quot; could be replaced by &quot; the rules , &quot; which would have allowed stricter application .
for the Islamists , that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society .
Liberals have to be hypocritical and think that this is just a question of advertising .
according to them , the Islamic@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
they relate , in particular , to Article 220 , which confers on the University @-@ Az@@ ar University a consultative role , in particular for anyone who must confirm its compliance with the laws of Sharia .
according to the expert in Egypt Sophia , it is disturbing that &quot; the people called to speak is not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
here we see the premises of a theocracy . &quot;
the fears of liberals are also increased by the fact that the next university manager would be rather less moderate than the current one .
&quot; for now , there is no concrete religious involvement .
with this Constitution we are in the context of the civil state .
most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not only a master but a university , some of them trained in the French system , &quot; explains Alexis Blokland , who prepares a thesis about Egypt &apos;s constitutional transition .
but it recognises that there may be some ambiguity surrounding Article 220 , as the terms used follows the religious vocabulary .
&apos; we refer in particular to the term &apos; i@@ q@@ h &apos; .
and the question that could be asked in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to express itself above all this . &quot;
beyond its religious character , the text voted on yesterday has received many criticisms which concern the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic .
the Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in comparison with those that were during the previous regime .
another contentious point : the powers conferred on the army .
under the desire of the military , the defense budget review will not be submitted to Parliament , but to a national defence council .
there will also be no ban on civil prosecutions in military tribunals , as demanded by human rights associations .
these were also concerns about the text , which they consider to be irresponsible .
the crime of blasphemy remains and , from now on , insults are banned , which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression , especially for the press .
moreover , no article emphasises the protection of women , stresses the safety of Human Rights Watch .
according to it , the only positive thing was the ban on torture under Article 36 .
the word was not in the previous Constitution .
although the Egyptian president was to come out yesterday evening on television , he is expected to take this lunchtime .
supporters of the head of state were demonstrating on Saturday .
in Israel , Ukrainian tourists expect their holy land , the world &apos;s greedy , and a sea of salt .
the promised Earth combines the maj@@ ic@@ ousness of biblical truths with modern comfort and nature in nature .
&quot; L@@ F &quot; identified the five most important reasons for Israel to be visited .
reversal in the Holy Land
it is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was dubbed .
it is believed that anyone who enters this &quot; mega @-@ evil &quot; will receive divine grace .
and DC reads , the place of Jesus &apos;s miracles : the conversion of water into wine in the pot , walking about the water , the appeasement of the storm , and the filled networks .
in the same place , Jesus appeared before his revival after the revival .
but the largest number of holy sites are in Jerusalem .
believers go here the Vi@@ ac@@ ru@@ ens or the Way of the Cross of Jesus ( in Latin , &quot; Via Baltica &quot; ) .
it starts in the fortress of Antonio , the Pretoria , where the trial took place , and continues on the streets of the Old City , it is going to the Holy buried in the Mount G@@ ó@@ l@@ drop , the place of the cruci@@ af@@ x@@ ion , to the Stone of Con@@ ation and to the place of Jesus of Jesus .
there is also the world &apos;s symbolic symbolic Christian , who symbolises humanity &apos;s salvation .
and the Holy Cross monastery in Jerusalem , built in the place where , according to a Christian slogan , there was a tree from which the cross was made for Jesus &apos;s cruci@@ af@@ x@@ ion .
in Jerusalem , there is also the most sacred place for the Jews , the Wall of hooliganism ; the remnants of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the 1970 &quot; s .
as is a tradition , people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes , which will then become a reality .
carrying a vertical trip
the ruins of Fortress Mas@@ ada were what was left of a secret haven against enemies , which Her@@ o@@ des the Great sent in the year 25 to his family .
they find themselves in the mountain areas at the level of 450 m on sea levels .
and to get it by their own means can only be invested in the escalation .
the rest of us can reach this historic summit in the eye .
and in the northern part of the country to an altitude of 16@@ 00 @-@ 2040 , the famous Her@@ y@@ ski ski station , where there is a large influx of tourists in the winter months .
so far , as far as bus services are concerned , bus services are provided .
the total length of ski paths is 45 km .
according to an old myth , at the top of the mountains they supposedly used to pay the gods .
visiting unique museums
there are about 300 museums in that country .
in one single journey , you will not be able to visit everyone .
but it is worth visiting at least five of them , the most interesting .
among them is the Israeli Museum , located near the Knesset ( Israeli Parliament ) .
it retains the former Man@@ ol of the Mu@@ he@@ o or Qu@@ uc@@ es , caught in the New desert desert , and around 500 000 archaeological and anthropo@@ ological parts .
it is worth visiting the Ar@@ te Museum in Tel Aviv .
in his presentation of paints , he has an impressive shock of the impressed and ex@@ pressure such as Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ ard , Ren@@ oir , C@@ ach@@ ne , S@@ no@@ ley , M@@ od@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ v@@ l or Pi@@ married .
it is possible to visit the Al @-@ bathing museum in Ac@@ ire , which is a number of long @-@ liners in Turkey , with the model figures of visitors and bathers from that time .
it is worth it worth passing through the exclusive private museum R@@ al@@ li , where the sculp@@ ies of R@@ od@@ n and Dal@@ í can be admired .
there is no tourist guidance there , nor is there any tents .
entry is free , and no donations are being accepted .
the fifth , the Holocaust Museum in Tel Aviv in Tel Aviv , shows one of the most dramatic pages in history .
the most tragic section is women &apos;s Memorial , which is built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and the gas chambers .
he was found in him and found out in absolute darkness .
stars are conspicuous .
and they sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives .
Ukraine is also mentioned .
health
Israel &apos;s three main tourist areas are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea , the Red Sea , and the M@@ ich Sea .
in every one of them , there are swimming pools , water parks , l@@ acks , and intercontinental museums .
it is strange that in the Red Sea it is even bathing in the winter months , since the temperature of the low of 21 degrees and air is growing up to 23 degrees .
the M@@ ich Sea is even warmer and is bathing throughout the year .
incidentally , this sea , the most extraordinary in the world , is at the lowest point on the planet : 4@@ 17 m below sea level .
the blue waters there are a cup that easily holds to those who do not know how to swim .
the landscapes in the surrounding area are truly beautiful .
people come here to move from dry treatment courses , die , and cure their health in cases of der@@ ti@@ tis , allergies , asthma , ec@@ z@@ ma , ar@@ tri@@ tis , CJD , diabetes , and to put their shattered nerves in order .
approaching Old Time of Old
it retains the old part of Tel Aviv , the city of Jos , on the Mediterranean coast .
it was the famous maritime route that joined Egypt , Syria , Anatolia , and Mesopotamia .
the city is mentioned in the former Greek and Egyptian treasuries .
according to the myth , it was here that No@@ é built his heart and Per@@ censeo rescued the beautiful An@@ ó@@ tu@@ ate with whom , in this very place , he took a long and happy life .
tourists love walking on the narrow streets that lead the names of the Z@@ od@@ o &apos;s signs .
they say that if the walls on the streets of your &apos; yourself &apos; symbol , the fortune will be favourable .
in Jos , couples who come from all parts of Israel , and even other countries , are to be found to take a stand .
and in C@@ are@@ a , the city of the King Her@@ o@@ des , you can walk around the Roman theatre , &quot; take &quot; the strength of the masters .
in the Roman era , C@@ are@@ a was the main city of Ju@@ ves and the residence of Roman doctors , including Pon@@ cio Pilate .
the carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera shows .
tourists remember
if you travel to Israel , you do not worry whether your English leaves much to be desired : in this country around 30 % of the population speaks Russian .
the money for this journey is not to be recommended in euros , but in dollars , which can easily be changed to sh@@ é@@ qu@@ els ( today 1 @-@ 3 $ 8 , 8 sh@@ é@@ qu@@ els ) .
urban transport is mainly buses , but it is fast @-@ track in Jerusalem , and in Haifa is the country &apos;s only underground line , which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City .
in reality , it is an underground smell .
travel in any kind of public transport costs 6 sh@@ é@@ qu@@ els and it is at this price that a travel can be transported by shipments for 1.5 hours .
in Israel , according to the Jewish tradition , the ink is celebrating the Saberi .
from Friday evening to the start of Saturday , markets and shops closed down and public transport cut off their work .
but Sunday morning a new working week begins .
in many cafés , restaurants , and hotels , only k@@ os@@ er , which excludes meat from pork , marital puppet , fish without beds , and plates in which milk and meat is combined , is ruled out .
there is a wide range of meat and lamb and lamb @-@ to @-@ sheep and lamb @-@ ready meat prepared with co@@ co@@ o milk , the traditional Hebrew cream known as nec@@ us , a wide variety of sal@@ ts , the shortage of fruit and vegetables .
in the streets of Israeli cities , they are not street dogs .
instead , there are many well @-@ fed cats that &quot; pay for their taste &quot; in a formidable way .
at night you can see them long even on the ceilings in the cars that were in place .
all those around the hills are delighted with the crowded places , and they do not reject those who have been beaten up .
the rent of a car , depending on the brand , will cost 37 $ 37 ( Hy@@ und@@ ai G@@ tz ) to $ 188 ( Au@@ di A6 , Volvo S@@ h ) per day .
in addition to the insurance , which goes for 15 @-@ day @-@ to @-@ day .
and the rent of a bicycle will come to him by 15 sh@@ é@@ qu@@ els on the day .
tickets to museums cost an average of 30 sh@@ é@@ qu@@ els .
Israel in figures
in 2012 , Israel visited more than three million tourists all over the world .
most of those who came to travel the country and rest were citizens of the US , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , the United Kingdom and Ukraine .
the proposed Earth , from January to October 2012 , was visited by 1@@ 18.@@ 8 000 Ukrainian tourists , which exceeds 51 % at the same rate in 2010 , before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011 .
&quot; big and powerful &quot; will take it to Moscow : immigrants save for the language
while MEPs and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination , they have already appeared in the prone country trading under &quot; false &quot; certificates .
every year , 13 million immigrants reach Moscow , St Petersburg , and other cities in Russia .
most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
their sole aim is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home .
since 1 December , a law has entered into force , according to which every job immigrant must carry out an examination in order to check his knowledge of the Russian language .
for now , this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector , community institutions , domestic services and retail trading .
however , over time , as promise by the Federal Service for Immigration , the tests will be made compulsory for all immigrants .
moreover , it will not be sufficient to pay for language examination , if not also Russian history and the basis of legislation .
language knowledge must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew work permits .
the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language are exceptions .
people who managed to obtain their education and diplomas certificates before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law .
usefulness , Hope , and Defense of Rights
the network of screening centres will work under the Institute of Len@@ a Russian P@@ ush@@ kin , the University of the People &apos;s Am@@ st@@ n , the State University in Moscow , the State University of St Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions .
immigrants will be able to stand for evidence in all cities , right now in Russia more than 160 centres of this kind are open .
the initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the members of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service .
but the defenders of rights , long before the law came into force , have often managed to put this question to the press : what will this actually bring about this ?
what changes will the obligation to make the language knowledge be compulsory , both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves ?
firstly , they respond to the representatives of the Immigration Service , which will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering from &apos; work slavery &apos; .
many people are talking today about defending the rights of labour immigrants , explains Victor Schwarzenberg , the head of the representation of Russia &apos;s Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan .
the defence of their rights must be opened before their starting point .
only an organised selection system will make it possible to solve the problem of migrant workers by 90 % of cases .
it is the immigrants without profession , education , those who do not know the language , and they do not pass the medical check .
without an understanding of the language , he claims that the future immigrant will be condemned to the unscrupulous people who , on the pretext of helping , give him a &quot; paid trip &quot; to a horrifying , narrow co @-@ trip , where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food and documents , working from 12 to 14 hours a day .
we receive a number of complaints from our immigrants .
&quot; in their homeland , they promise one thing , but when they arrive , they are deprived of their passports , they are not paid for promised wages , &quot; the chief of the immigration Directorate of Tajikistan from Tajikistan &apos;s immigration service confirms , Tom@@ as Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v .
you are not angry !
however , in the meantime , many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognise that not only do they not know the language of the country to which they intend to go , but in their own language they write with difficulty .
of course , this is not so much their fault , but their own misfortune : there are few of them , Uzbek , t@@ ay@@ k@@ k@@ os who can afford to receive normal primary education .
this is due to the fact that their families even have nothing to give food to the children , not to talk about wearing them , to eat them and to buy them what they need for school .
when we arrive in young people , these boys venture to work at the earliest opportunity .
it is difficult , if the language is not known , to recognise them .
&quot; you feel humiliated and lower . &quot;
however , as far as the law on language is concerned , the defenders of rights point to an important point .
the tests will only be carried out for those immigrants whose status is legal .
if they do not have that status , there will be no examination and , consequently , no official work .
meanwhile , most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
&quot; I welcome or banned the passage to strangers . &quot;
many visitors say that receiving official status in our country is not so easy .
the cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself .
in addition , the legalisation costs money : from 12 000 to 16 thousand of them .
however , a false registration can be done quickly and for just a thousand hundred thousand .
people in the Russian police know that we usually carry out false documents , we are not listed and they are the cases of extortion .
&quot; they ask us for a hundred or two hundred years for cigarettes or tea , &quot; he told journalists the citizen of Tajikistan , U@@ med H@@ ush@@ k@@ am@@ ov .
&apos;@@ We are not going to be allowed to have a paint &apos; , you are not going to buy paint &apos; .
the first day of the entry into force of the law on language , it became apparent that not only the immigrant registration documents can be false .
several &apos; false &apos; certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by officials of the Federal Aviation Service .
counterfeit documents had been printed in standard colour printing .
of course , they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift : every immigrant , they wanted to make it easier to pass the test , paid for the document seven thousand .
this is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure , which will cost the migrant worker three thousand .
the main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that &quot; diplomas &quot; cannot be bought , converge between government officials and rights defenders .
so far , the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to manage the first time to study the basic language course .
moreover , immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people .
the Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
the percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small .
the Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigid in relation to civilian @-@ use weapons .
this is the government &apos;s reaction to the recent incidents : to press for marriage celebrations in which there were fortunately no victims , and the massacre initiated by the Si@@ co@@ ho@@ ite lawyer , Dimit@@ ri V@@ in@@ ac@@ do@@ ov , in which seven people lost their lives .
the police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for licence to carry out weapons , from 18 years to 21 years .
this idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and combating corruption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ ar@@ o@@ aya , who promised that reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be taken to the State Duma in the near future .
not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying &quot; hard @-@ hand politics . &quot;
in the network , an open letter has appeared , the authors of which , representatives of various social organisations , demand that they be discouraged from such &apos; senseless rigour &apos; measures .
the percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons was minimal , commented on the BBC news service from Russia , the criminal lawyer V@@ asi@@ li@@ li@@ y L@@ é@@ ni@@ kov .
according to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior , 142 crimes with the use of firearms have been committed for six months in the interior , in the face of the total of 1@@ 168 crimes held for the same period .
the authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the arms @-@ use sector will not be a disadvantage for the criminal to address the black market .
now , according to your words , any weapon can be found in Moscow at low prices .
meanwhile , the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control .
suppliers : from factories to officials
the black market in arms is supplied through several channels .
the main channels are years , it says the Colonel withdrawn Victor Bar@@ an@@ nets , who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High state .
foot @-@ capture from the Web site that accepts orders of arms
the first is &quot; relic of the army or military &quot; - that is , the weapons that were stolen during military action in the Caucasus .
&quot; the weapons were driven by Russian officers and by the same Caucasus , &quot; says Bar@@ an@@ nets .
the next type of &quot; black weapon , &quot; those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces .
Bar@@ an@@ nets explains that this is included in the weapons held by police stores and those directly stolen by officials of law enforcement bodies .
illegal weapons are to be sold from military arsenals .
in many military arsenals , there were often explosions .
&quot; there are proven versions that some fires were carried out intentionally to cover the absence , &quot; he has commented on a military release .
according to Bar@@ an@@ nets , the arms manufacturers also do its bit .
&quot; they have now proliferate private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under a string of the black market , including Moscow &apos;s , &quot; says the expert .
one more source of the black market is smuggling .
a large number of guns and machine machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan .
&quot; there has its own , sometimes small @-@ scale production , and it has been a mafia that has organised the arms flow , &quot; explains the former military .
where are the weapons coming from ?
the experts have calculated how almost each of these sources of illegal arms is involved in the black market .
a report on this subject was drawn up in 2011 by the centre of analysis of problems and planning for public management .
the specialists examined reports by the Ministry of the Interior and Ros@@ st@@ at , criminal literature and public access data of portals whose thematic theme revolves around arms .
the vast majority of illegal weapons , according to researchers , come from the armed forces and the security forces .
half of the weapons in the black market have arrived there , because of officials whose work is related to weapons , &quot; it is said in the report .
according to researchers , 17 % of arms come from where there are armed conflicts , 14 % of cases stolen during arms production , and 5 % for the &quot; illegal archaeological . &quot;
the reliance on one of the arms shops , who called for his surname not to be mentioned , says that weapons found by illegal per@@ ators did not buy them for a long time now , because they are too old .
more often , it says , suppliers run for military stores when they need a departure .
the supplier is buying a unit , for example , an FTT .
they get rid of the register and pass them over to the fence .
&apos;@@ This carries the weapon to the city and sells it to EUR 900 per unit with two chargers &apos; , we have the right to see us .
&quot; but , of course , the police is aware of all the issues , so regularly , when the plan for the discovery of crimes is to be met , they carry out trials on illegal arms traders , &quot; adds the dependent .
&quot; as in luxury . &quot;
the seller and the buyer tend to be found through well @-@ known people .
&quot; I visited Web pages and blogs until a kind that proposed to me outside the &quot; B@@ eg@@ o@@ aya &quot; platform , where a man would lead me to a &quot; li@@ ite &quot; where we could negotiate .
at the price of the gun , I heard only there . &quot;
military commentator Viktor Bar@@ an@@ nets
&quot; to get a weapon , I need a friend who has contacts , &quot; he says that he is dependent on the shop . &quot; I have a friend like that , but I do not have much confidence in him . &quot;
there are sellers on the markets , but there too , we say , &apos; on the part of Mr Iversen , who asked to say that he had fallen into his daughter &apos; .
I can even get a pair of steel companies through a person of trust .
he , too , is only supplied to me because he knows that I am not going to get it down .
old people look for weapons in different ways .
former military former Viktor Bar@@ an@@ nets was tested on the role of illegal arms buyer in the mid 1990 &quot; s , when it was available to publish an article on this subject .
the schemes , according to your words , have not changed .
he gave him an al@@ bu@@ m of photos where there was no &quot; all . &quot;
&quot; I felt as in a luxury box , &quot; reminds us of the military .
to the buyer , according to Bar@@ an@@ nets , they do not offer a cat in the eyes : all that is needed can be tested .
I , as a potential customer , not only buy , or go with the seller , where we set a target .
&quot; I give me the opportunity to shoot , and when I assure you that the weapon triggers well , we started to negotiate , &quot; the expert is described .
the B@@ ain &apos;s B@@ ain
web @-@ search engines lead to sites and groups of &quot; V@@ k@@ on@@ t@@ ak@@ te , &quot; where it is offered to buy weapons &quot; for different purposes . &quot;
this does not require any documents or personal meetings .
&quot; it is enough to have a certain amount of money , &quot; they write in the title of the advertising warning &quot; understand a gun or a gun . &quot;
there , the users are making orders and they ask questions .
and selling minors ?

and the people are , as fish hungry to c@@ bo , and then to extract coal in Siberia .
military and ex@@ military commentator Viktor Bar@@ nets
I have heard about these systems : as a rule , the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws .
people are making orders .
the buyer makes payment through an automatic farmer .
&quot; in response , they send him a photo and the instructions to tell us where the weapon is hidden , &quot; the NGO &apos;s press secretary &quot; The right to weapons , &quot; Dmitri Nour .
Viktor Bar@@ an@@ nets say that if there is a call in line , one is left without a weapon and put it in prison .
the Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and capture to those who want to buy firearms .
&quot; and people are going , as fish hungry to trap , and then to extract coal in Siberia , &quot; he says .
Ma@@ k@@ anov for 100 dollars
in the purchase of illegal firearms , according to the experts , one can spend 100 @-@ 900 dollars .
according to Dmitri Kisangani of the NGO &apos;s &quot; the right to arms , &quot; a M@@ ik@@ ov gun can be purchased for $ 100 @-@ 300 .
we will have to wait a month and a half .
it has been sent out from the military warehouses of middle @-@ class bosses .
according to official ministry statistics , compared with the period January @-@ October 2011 , the total number of these crimes in Russia has been reduced by 7 % , which is 10 % , and the number of cases identified for theft and extortion of weapons , munitions , explosives and explosives has decreased by 7.8 % .
it is on strike for the early food restaurant workers and supermarkets in the US .
up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first work as cash machines in &apos; McDonald &apos;s &apos; .
in the last few days , in the United States , a wave of protests against low wages in supermarkets in the Wal@@ t Corporation and in restaurants of popular fast @-@ food chains , such as &quot; McDonald &apos;s is &quot; , &quot; Th@@ is@@ er King , &quot; , &quot; Th@@ o Bel@@ l &quot; , &quot; W@@ is@@ o Bel@@ l , &quot; &quot; W@@ n@@ o &quot; and &quot; K@@ ent@@ ul@@ s &quot; and &quot; K@@ ent@@ uc@@ ky For@@ ri@@ ky Fr@@ ed Ch@@ ick@@ en &quot; .
for now , no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach the nine points , or whether it will have to lose forces and love in its early stages .
protest actions have the support of the trade unions and a number of left @-@ wing NGOs .
in addition to the increase in modest wages received by Wal@@ mar@@ t workers and the rapid food system , the aim of the protests organisers is the creation of labor unions in these companies .
for now , this sector of the economy has practically not been dealt with by the trade union movement .
is it a case of six cents per year ?
the actions started last week , following the Agenda for Action Day , the so @-@ called &apos; Black Friday &apos; : that day , in the United States , it took up the orgy of cuts that captured millions of inhabitants , and sometimes accompanied by clashes .
on that day , some of the Wal@@ mar@@ t Corporation , which employs 2.2 million people in the world , abandoned its jobs and formed a record of protest alongside the trade unions and left @-@ wing activists in the corporation &apos;s shops , whose products are directed at modest and moderate incomes .
Wal@@ mar@@ t sells all of everything from its infancy , horse @-@ hunt , car @-@ to @-@ cars batteries , even in anticipation of eggs , eggs , and milk .
products in their shops are on average between 8 % and 27 % cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets .
that is why many ill @-@ paid workers from Wal@@ t buy only work .
the availability and mix of products has made Wal@@ t one of America &apos;s largest corporations .
according to the two critics , Wal@@ t can afford to sell low @-@ price products , partly because it pays little for its workers .
the latter are also complaining about poor working conditions , such as the lack of , or in the case of , the sheep or scanners .
that &quot; Black Friday &quot; participants in the demonstration demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to $ 100 per month .
for a typical manager of Wal@@ mar@@ t , who receives $ 9.5 per hour , this spending is excessive , they said .
scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Wal@@ p increases the average wage to $ 12 per hour , this will cost the $ 3.2 trillion .
that is about 1.1 % more than it spends on wages now .
if Obama puts the wage increase on consumers &quot; shoulders , every visit to the shop will prove to be only 46 cents more expensive .
in a year , they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12.@@ 39 dollars more than they now spend .
supporters of Wal@@ mar@@ t are satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and caused no loss to the corporation .
the &quot; Black Friday &quot; prolonged in their shops since 8 o &apos;clock on Thursday afternoon until midnight on the next day , and during that time Wal@@ t sold around 5 000 articles per second .
in total , their boxes recorded &quot; Black Friday &quot; almost 100 million transactions .
the company &apos;s representative , Dan Bhatti , declared in an interview to the left @-@ wing Hu@@ f@@ g@@ g@@ ton Post , who left its &quot; less than five &quot; employees , and that the protest had been no more than &quot; another public relations trick , &quot; organized by the workers &quot; union .
&apos;@@ C@@ ade free ! &apos;
the protests continued in New York this week , in which the targets were not exactly the grand Wal@@ t stores - which they do not appreciate in this progressive city - and for now there are none , but the &quot; McDonald &apos;s &quot; and other cheap restaurants .
McDonald &apos;s says that he sells billions of pieces , and then you do not even give up the disease and do not pay for your honest work !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Williams , a member of the New York City Council .
today , according to federal law and that of New York , the minimum wage is $ 7.@@ 25 per hour .
fast @-@ food restaurants will increase it over time , but only slightly , and on average , ordinary workers are receiving $ 8.7 per hour in New York .
nobody wins less than they do in the city .
how it is possible to survive in New York with that money , for me , is incomprehensible .
there was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald &apos;s and worked there , behind the masters , part @-@ time after the school , even though they were still living with their parents .
few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time .
now , we constantly encounter some interviews with McDonald &apos;s workers who complain that they have to live on this pay , and sometimes even feed their children .
on the other hand , in a forum in the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to give them to eat .
participants in the protests , which began at 6 : 30 from Thursday morning in McDonald &apos;s &quot; s of the 4@@ 0@@ th Street and Man@@ are A@@ ven@@ ar , demanded that fast @-@ food machines and cook be started to pay at least 15 per hour , in other words , to double their current minimum wage .
they also demanded that the fast @-@ food sector create labor unions .
the US law forbids the administration to prevent this right and to punish the activists of the trade union movement with claims and redundancies .
on the other hand , they rarely make life easier for them .
but , for objective reasons , it is easy for trade unions to cover the rapid food industry .
one of the main is the excessive rotation of staff .
dissenting
noisy protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
the culmination of the action took place by half the meeting in McDonald &apos;s situated near Times , in which several local Democratic politicians , in particular the member of the municipal council , took part , who said : &quot; McDonald &apos;s says that he is selling billions of portions , then not even a hospital or pays for his honest work . &quot;
protesters received the support of other prominent democrats in New York , for example the presidential candidate in the city &apos;s Bill of B@@ si@@ o , who said that &quot; we must support fast @-@ food workers in order to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that every neo @-@ Westphalia &quot; deserve . &quot;
as the New York Times described it , this has been the largest demonstration of this kind in the US history of fast @-@ food .
but only a few hundred people were involved in it , even not all of them were employees in the fast @-@ food service , in which tens of thousands of people in New York were fought .
it is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark for a massive movement .
&quot; for now , deceiving the brain is not so easy &quot; . &quot;
the issue of the increased reality that is so popular among modern technologies is recently perceived to be mostly normal through the prism of special glasses .
at the beginning of the summer , in its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in movement , and then , in November , it was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the relevant patent .
however , from a conversation with the head of the interactive technology group 3@@ D in the Microsoft laboratory of Cambridge , Iz@@ i S@@ har@@ am@@ om , it has been clarified that for the scientists from that company , glasses have already belonged to a past stage .
they attract the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with naked hands and the creation of open , open spaces .
- In general terms , what is the purpose of study by your research group ?
we are devoting ourselves to personal and computer interaction , but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction .
for now , humanity in its vast mass has been trapped at the working stage with the viewers on the flat screen , sometimes it is on the finger .
but we want to look 5 @-@ 10 years ahead and guess the dynastic changes in this interaction .
for example , the single X@@ box and the Glenys Kinnock represent a step forward , and today no X@@ box is sold without Kinnock , because it is in everyone &apos;s interest to control by gesture .
what is the future in the future ?
despite the fact that Kinnock has led to the interaction of the physical level , much of it still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3@@ D .
the introduction of information has improved ( the system receives more data ) , and the way out is not very good .
we are trying to change this , we are working in truly three @-@ dimensional screening systems , based on different technologies , including design .
the world of information technology must be released for our physical , physical , more tangible .
for this , however , it is necessary to recognise not only the user , but also the area surrounding it .
we will then be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way .
first of all , to the devil with those fools of virtual reality !
- What do you think about voice control ?
a very popular detail , but do you not think that they are over@@ thinking ?
- It is not always possible to solve the issue of privacy , of course , and that it is not always to be a panacea , because it is not always the case that the others will hear about our actions and intentions .
in fact , all types of computer interaction are good , but each in its own field .
for example , for regulatory control in public places , we had a project in which we thought of gestures , but not in loose movements , but rather shorter .
moreover , gestures were captured not by the device of the device , but by a pain that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles .
for now it is very large , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a pain clock .
in general , however , the future is for a combined type of control , for example , of gesture + .
- How is that ?
for example , how would you ask me to pass on to him this kind of so@@ da ?
you will speak and show it at the same time .
I am only speaking .
- oh , that is going to be very difficult to recognize .
but do you want to force users to adapt to what can or cannot be done at the moment in the machine ?
that is not necessarily , but it is a mutual rapprochement .
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensory , which will accurately determine the people &apos;s reactions .
these may , for example , be sensational , because they provide a very good resolution in depth , which is very important .
if we are talking about your work with the sensational results of the X@@ box Kinnock , what complaints do you have of the modern cameras ?
is it lacking in resolution , in depth or more ?
- In principle , today &apos;s generation is what may be the start of our work with three @-@ dimensional recognition .
it would , of course , be good to obtain 8 mega @-@ books at the speed of 1000 f@@ tes .
but the question is not about the mega @-@ honey , but about the quality of the parent and in the depth .
from this last point of view , all the current technologies are not good enough for us ; this gives more work to the designers of algorithms .
so we have to remember not only the resolution on the X lines and , but also in Zurich .
speed , the number of tables per second , is also important .
the human movements are quite dynamic , and the current 30 @-@ corps today is truly rare , especially for gestures .
in our laboratory in K@@ agan , St@@ af@@ shi@@ che of our laboratory has made a mockery of adjusting to 1 @-@ 100 periods , and it is worth mentioning that a series of a series of a series of technologies that have been produced in series are closer to the second value ( 60 @-@ 100 ) .
not everyone understands to what extent this affects human @-@ machine interaction .
it would be very useful to me for my work to be an equivalent of such a device , but it would not require contact for the second tables to be more .
and does the number of cameras not need to be increased ?
- The IPCC now has three &quot; cameras , &quot; one of which is in fact the under @-@ classification and the second the recipient of the signal reflected .
but the third chamber is in fact a mere sensational from the visible di@@ ol .
this is not used to determine the depth of the object .
potentially more cameras could solve the problem ...
on the contrary , it will increase and increase the amount required for calculations .
it would be good to create a similar flexible approach , to play with the window of location of the cameras and to see how this would help to determine the three @-@ dimensional position .
as far as I remember , Microsoft , unlike Google , has not presented its glasses to the public .
do you not think that , from the point of view of the daily use of increased technology , glasses are one of the most visible platforms ?
of course , taking all the time by holding a smart phone in the hands is not very convenient , but I think that the best option would be an increased &quot; trans@@ table reality &quot; when , on the basis of a cloud platform , you could move from glasses to the smart phone .
glasses are very personal devices , here is their strength ( the private things you will only see ) , but also their weakness : an increased reality based on glasses will not allow them to work on virtual objects along with others .
let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual items in the air in the air is available not only to Tony Start of the film &quot; Ir@@ on M@@ an , &quot; but also for any simple death .
there is a problem in this idea that critics often point out : there is no tactical answer !
you do not have anything !
what answers is your group preparing for this challenge ?
- I often say in my conferences that the increased reality is the seventh explosion in the interaction between man and machine .
I think the eighth @-@ term might well be the addition of ver@@ m@@ le feelings .
in the meantime , one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as an image @-@ building .
there is a great deal of sympathy .
but there are also technologies that are genuinely designed to make these &quot; images in the air &quot; true , for example , interference by several different @-@ rays directed at a specific point where the finger gives a sense of similar to which you feel if anyone is blowing in the y@@ st@@ als of fingers , but that sense is still very weak .
there is also a great deal of red tape , which is an impact on the nerve of the fingers of my fingers , which is also a promising direction .
- has he tried to deceive the brain ?
do you think that he feels what it seems that should be felt at the time he sees something ?
- That is a good idea , we have not yet tried .
there is another challenge here , which we will have to fight for a long time , how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it is open to an open space , almost without an end , and we are also working on the idea of the taking @-@ up rooms , not as those of the gy@@ ists , of mobile platforms , as well as of giants .
for now , deceiving the brain is not so easy , it still needs to work for many years .
that is what makes work attractive to the virtual reality for researchers , that many things are in a state of total conception .
subjective personal personal rather than culture - Rosales
&apos;@@ Ros@@ r@@ t &apos; continues with the project &apos; pioneering St Petersburg &apos; , dedicated to citizens in front of us , at the forefront of art and culture .
in this list of the best ones , the art and scene of St Petersburg , whose achievements go beyond the city , are often recognised in Europe without even knowing them .
the new hero of &quot; Ros@@ bal@@ t &quot; is the bizarre odious artist Miller .
the whole city is familiar with Kemal Miller , a top @-@ out man who is dressed up from top @-@ down red Museum , which can be found close to the Ru@@ so , close to J@@ o of Ver@@ ano or in fashionable and fashionable meetings .
Nikita Miller tables always attract crowds , wherever they are displayed .
Sak@@ ll Miller is one of the purely socio @-@ Catholic fanatics of St. Petersburg , the creators of new o@@ to@@ o@@ ologists .
Sak@@ ll Miller is a brilliant representative of St Petersburg &apos;s pioneering pursuit of the late 1980 &quot; s , the early 1990 &quot; s .
moreover , he is an urban man , whose appearance on the streets of the city raises the smiles and raises all of the state of mind .
recently , he took in his hands a body and became the St. Petersburg bed , since he has matured to make such difficult role , for his pu@@ li@@ tic existence , his philosophy and image .
- There is a problem , why are they in the city of the city dressed in red and non @-@ yellow or white , for example ?
I chose the red colour because I am a fashionable designer and I look at the appearance and image .
in this world , red colour is a compromise between the artist , the images of images and society .
even if it is not a little grey in society , there is nothing good about aggression and disorder .
but my provocations are directed at a conversation .
the whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate .
- When you understood that you should be an artist ?
- In an exhibition of the Culture Palace Palace , where my work was displayed .
I realised that that was my path .
the wave of old non @-@ official artists was then over , and the new , free as I did , were still unknown .
I was a friend of the new wave , with subsequent to those who were exposing in Gaza and Nestlé , which led to &quot; P@@ ush@@ k@@ in@@ k@@ aya @-@ 10 , &quot; and the new wave is over .
I am in the theatre for clothes , the music of all sexes , but not by letters .
- and all of this was all the more worked out in your art Ch@@ is@@ ic of art - for me it was important to meet the cultural centre in St Petersburg , where the best creative minds were to be met .
in 1995 , I took a territory in P@@ ush@@ k@@ in@@ k@@ aya @-@ 10 , and there , as long as there were no reforms , there was a musical music club , a Real club , the St Petersburg house of the white @-@ fire house .
many were born there : N@@ om@@ s , T@@ equ@@ el J@@ á@@ z , I remember how Sch@@ n@@ ur brought the project to &quot; The S@@ o@@ ars of Van Gogh . &quot;
Sch@@ n@@ ur and his friends blew up small light songs , in the run @-@ up , among them the currently fashionable reader of fashion I@@ or V@@ do@@ vin .
when the group began to play alive , it became &quot; Lennart . &quot;
Tr@@ ach@@ ten@@ berg was a fan of many programs before the era of H@@ ali @-@ g@@ ali@@ ul@@ h .
we gave them to Tr@@ ach@@ ten@@ berg and it was the start of their great career ; basic education and training were received from us .
visitors &quot; D 137 , &quot; the &quot; T@@ gi@@ z@@ ed@@ ov Club , are the leftovers of the Ar@@ te Ar@@ te .
they were on our employees and on regular customers .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
in 2000 , the survey took place in the press , the prize was &quot; The people of our city . &quot;
in the nomination &apos; artist of the Year &apos; , I was elected , so my culmination was .
in these new times it is not comfortable to work ; I am a man who likes the truth , honesty and culture of the past century .
it is easy to learn in our times , but culture and popularity are separate , one can be popular but very little cult .
- There are something that is recognisable in your work .
- Many of my paints are in excess , in them clearly expressed today and the event .
I am going to make a planned exposure , &apos; The Ru@@ so @-@ in @-@ charge &apos; .
clow@@ ons are a yellow @-@ sounding category .
I was sociological earlier , but now it is painful and frightening .
however , all of them are running out in the ballot box , and the tragedy is removed .
I love the grotesque , I have grotesque ideas .
for example , the world &apos;s salvation through a totalitarian and compulsory change in clothes .
now , you are still in favour of clothes , as it is on the outside , but not within the person .
and perhaps that person should not be given a hand , but hiding behind him .
and the deception will be eliminated when they change their clothes .
we saw little about the role of urban navigation , and a hero , a city , must have such a hero .
who better than me to be !
well , well , do commercial art best be beautiful ?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous , sweet , calm .
we are witnessing the disintegration of cultures .
previously , people were grouped together , the men of Ministers wanted one thing , the simple others .
now everyone has been divided into micro@@ communities , it is hard to please everyone .
I am not a $ 100 ticket to like everyone .
now we need to think about whom you want to like .
now , every hero of worship has his 100 fanatics .
- and to listen to S@@ ites Mikko , thousands of people arrive .
- you will see that you have been abandoned , that is the gender @-@ social sphere .
as a result , 10 000 people will never come , as a result , less money , less money , all of them .
I have the most important of me , the most important thing is not to deceive them , not to lose what they have achieved .
when he was young he made such signs that a collection would have to hang on the wall on the wall side of the F@@ k and L@@ on@@ ov .
I began with paints , which people usually end up .
now they often confuse concepts .
they say a spiritual culture , a culture of consumption .
there is no culture in consumption , that is another story .
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture , and I grew up in the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty , denied money only to paint tables .
I am in favour of this culture .
what is missing from St Petersburg ?
- Buenos experts in culture .
there is a concept : a culture official .
but not all of them can engage in culture .
when kings were the right everything was otherwise , kings may not understand culture very well , but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts .
in Moscow , there are now very good consultants .
we have people in St Petersburg who could well be experts , but they are closed , because experts are needed at a higher level than properly assessing and opening them up .
now the subjective personal taste is flourishing .
the same was true , but the difference is that they say honestly that not all the modern art is accepted , there are some artists who have to look for other museums .
- What is St Petersburg ?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital ; there is much more culture in Moscow , there is ground there .
but on our stones it is difficult for art to grow .
we need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers , that is bad .
in Europe , there are a lot of people who are curious to hear and concerts .
in our case , this class is very small .
we need to make art fashionable , as it was at the beginning of the last century .
the project will be implemented with a subsidy from St Petersburg .
in the light of the space
the Earth is in danger .
global warming or clash with a murderer , a murderer .
in search of a spare world , five @-@ day human @-@ , @-@ human space vessels are on board .
in order to preserve humanity , the main question is : how can we continue the species under conditions of in@@ taxed and the same spare planet ?
I think there is little to choose .
in fact , only two are true planets that can be colonised , at least threatening .
&quot; these are V@@ u@@ us and Mars , &quot; says the researcher chief of the astronomical State Institute , Sher@@ berg P@@ .@@ K ( IATA ) , Vladimir Surkov .
but if the conditions in Mars are better for life , in the surface of V@@ u@@ us the temperature is 500 degrees .
we can only live on large and large @-@ scale highlands or in the orbit of V@@ a@@ us ... in space .
breeding problems in space with the flora were started to be addressed .
it is now half a century that experiments with plants were carried out .
four generations of gu@@ is@@ ins cultivated in orbit were not differentiated in any of the land varieties .
then wine was taken into orbit in orbit , small fruit flies , the can@@ ranks .
in 1979 eggs were sent to check how the embryo develops under conditions of greed .
we are getting a normal shell .
but then the problems start .
&quot; the problem is that this puzzle has to find support , it must stand on its own feet , and start to move , &quot; explains Vladimir Sy@@ ch@@ ev , the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Public Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences .
by failing to find support , the lights took over by chance .
and after 10 hours in the newcomers , a total of instincts were found .
nuts did not react to light or sound .
and the misfortune was that four days later , they simply died .
&quot; and two times we managed to get the bathwater , but then let us leave it because it was impossible to work there , &quot; he said Vladimir Symeou about the failure of the experiment in space .
the last time a bio @-@ spotlight was flying to the orbit 16 years ago .
experiments will continue in the spring of 2013 .
but in the &quot; Bi@@ on &quot; elite , they will only travel in the same sex .
there was an experiment with rats , which were sent to space already with foetuses .
in principle , there was nothing in the world .
&quot; this was precisely in the biosphere , but this was a unique experiment , and studies like this must be carried out , &quot; says Vladimir Symeou .
after the landing , space rats had offspring .
however , the problem of reproduction directly in space has not been achieved .
it is a difficult challenge .
animals , losing their usual habitat , simply cannot carry out their sexual instinct .
the man , however , unlike small animals , in principle can .
the Ho@@ us@@ s@@ us has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an appropriate emotional fund .
similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons .
however , women have been travelling to space for 50 years now .
the greatest risk happened in Ter@@ h@@ kova .
the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body .
our foot the air , and no one in the Earth could say : if it is after a flight to space .
it will be able or not to have a baby after this flight .
&quot; after all , this question has not been answered , &quot; he commented on the former aerospace industry to be dealt with .
in June 1964 , only after a year of the space flight to the space , the first women &apos;s first @-@ man @-@ in @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ eye , gave birth to a daughter .
the girl &apos;s father , the child , was a mon@@ k@@ ite .
in 1988 , the second @-@ woman second @-@ man , S@@ ve@@ t@@ wool S@@ avi@@ t@@ sk@@ aya , who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space , had a child .
yet the risk persists .
there are few of us who are numbered astronomical for those after long flights that have proved well , and a healthy generation is growing .
&quot; and if one can say more , it is dangerous even in orbit such a page , &quot; sums up the t@@ us@@ mon@@ ta pilot , a hero of the Soviet Union , a hero of Russia , Val@@ y@@ Pol@@ ak@@ ov .
however , humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology , in radiological protection , in the creation of artificial gravity .
a compulsory stage in the preparations for the flight is a compulsory stage in the Centre for the preparation of the Basque model .
under no conditions of nil , the Basque people practice their working skills in space .
the water is ridiculous .
if water is a comfortable , yet still hostile , environment for a newborn child , it is its native element .
small @-@ men and boys seem to confirm that life on the land emerged from the ocean .
there is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months from its mother in the am@@ ni@@ tic liquid , as it will be easier to get used to water .
in principle , this is logical , because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bathing only passes by 2 weeks .
&quot; that is very little to forget about , &quot; says Navy Ak@@ en@@ ova , a newly @-@ born home @-@ born home .
in short , if greed is a more natural state for a newborn , for women it is necessary to persist , the strength of gravity .
the ability to expel the unborn from the unborn is reduced by the lack of a disproportionate burden .
well , we ignore that , relying on the action of encouraging childbirth .
it is , of course , possible to give birth in a special chamber , and this will be driven .
&quot; and then , what ? &quot; the original question is made by Val@@ i Pol@@ y@@ ov .
on the other hand , the child also needs artificial gravity .
without the sense of gravity , the body does not generate the framework or the muscle system .
a newly born born into orbit is impossible to wear with a special design for training , such as adults .
he will simply be deprived of what is vital to him .
&quot; and this experiment that we are going to do together , by allowing a child in a strange environment , will lead to the Earth to a disabled , an entirely un@@ adapted person , &quot; provides for the head of the Ethics Committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , I@@ g@@ g@@ ov .
for now , the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue .
in time , however , this will become a reality , when humans in their boats are headed for a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space .
the head of N@@ K@@ W : the inspection of the &quot; š@@ an@@ c &quot; system has not given the guilty politician .
with regard to public procurement , the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation , even if it is applied in the form of them .
Mr Milošević , Vice @-@ President of the Supreme Control Office ( N@@ K@@ S ) in an interview for Ak@@ tu@@ n@@ n@@ n@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ ala , claims this .
&quot; the law will never be perfect , &quot; but its application must be correct . &quot; in my view , what is lacking , &quot; so is the current situation .
the joint controls by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions .
as an example of incorrect practice , it mentions the attitude of Médecins Ne@@ č@@ as to the system of being self @-@ employed only on paper , known as the &apos; š@@ an@@ c &apos; system .
the prime minister recently said that the SDGs ( Civic Democratic Party ) would not bother employers with inspectors .
&quot; the law must be regulated in some way , and if it prohibits something , in that case , nor can the government president prevent action from the office that has an obligation to carry out such controls or demand obligations , &quot; notes .
at the meeting of the committee of control in the Congress of Deputies , the joint draft between the Czech and German team was discussed in the context of which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared .
what exactly is ?
this is a parallel monitoring which we started to do about two years ago .
to put it simply : European legislation regulates how public procurement is to be organised , which is the practice of legislation in force in each country and then practice itself .
we have combined everything and , even if the control has not yet been completed , we have obtained very interesting differences , and , generally , the legislation in our country is &apos; stricter and more complete &apos; , but the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany .
it is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules , but rather to focus on the application of the law itself .
what can this project do , and what does it think is the conclusions ?
it is precisely such a common control of this kind that it could help to avoid investing in the legislation , reduction and improvement of limits , although this does not have such a positive impact .
the economy of savings means achieving a reasonable price for a reasonable price ( which does not always mean the lower price ) to prevent enrichment , and , in the long run , criminal action .
but not by reducing the allocation limit means we are going to achieve it .
perhaps because the system is saturated with so much &quot; paperwork , &quot; those who want to seek flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were maintained as high as now .
it talks about the problems of our country , with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement .
how does the control system work in Germany ?
is it a similar office to our N@@ K@@ W , or is it organised differently ?
as to how much of the offices , such as the N@@ K@@ S , is acting as the Federal Court of Auditors , with a similar organisation to ours , with a college as well , is only in its case structured in a different way , but in principle both offices are in parallel .
but , as Germany has a federal organisation , the courts of accounts are even at this level , and is slightly different from our system .
the Federal Court of Auditors ( Brok ) can only control the federal money , which we call state funds here .
public funds , which are administered by the regions and municipalities , there in Germany , are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors .
as far as local legislation is concerned , is it easier than ours ?
I would not , however , like to draw a comparison without any specific information , but Germany is still a model in some respects , but it cannot be clarified exactly what is best .
could it be better , for example , in the quality of inspectors ?
I am not sure but , I repeat , I do not like to make such comparisons .
it needs to be said that even those countries that we take as a model face a large number of problems .
if this were not the case , it would be no benefit to them to work with our office , do not believe it ?
as for the legislation in our country , what was the law amendment on public procurement to be used for its office , and is it in any way apparent ?
in view of the fact that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , it has not yet been expressed in the monitoring activities .
given that we carry out ex @-@ post controls , we need to have some delay .
for now , the process of preparing future controls is being observed : we have launched a new tool of &apos; non @-@ economic risk detection &apos; , which we have taken up almost 14 public contracts , which have been analysed , and the changes will be fully reflected here , since the limits are amended , conditions of some types of the selection process and similar .
does it consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or , rather , is a muddle for the bureaucratic system ?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it will .
the problem that may arise is that the regulation is &quot; restrictive &quot; and that it is impossible to fulfil it .
already under the previous regulation , controlled people were linked to the contractor ( for example , in the case of regional management programs of the regional council ) , and every non @-@ respected law on public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline .
is it therefore sensible to tighten the law in this way ?
I do not think so .
the system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure , which has no effect on decision @-@ making .
such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure .
and how is that to be done ?
we will see where this path has taken us .
the prime minister has recently declared that the SDGs would not bother employers with controls of the so @-@ called š@@ ic system , referring to the fact that they are self @-@ employed on paper , and what does that mean ?
is the š@@ ic system forbidden or allowed ?
the law must be regulated in some way and , if it prohibits something , then even the first government minister can prevent action from the Office which has an obligation to carry out these controls and demand obligations .
you can say : &apos; we change the law and we allow it &apos; , but you cannot say that we will do nothing .
in the law on public procurement , the rules are quite strict in terms of the way in which they should be conducted formally , and that is how it should be to protect public competition .
on the other hand , however , it is tragic that the candidate is excluded from the best offer by not complying with the formal requirements .
the law will never be perfect , but its application must be correct .
roads have ice plates , most of which are feasible .
in several places in the Czech Republic roads have ice and snow plates .
although the majority of the routes are feasible , caution must be stepped up .
the region of Kar@@ ward and Varosha
today , the roads in the region of Karelia and Varosha were in place , but they had ice and snow panels .
the temperature is falling , and will vary from five to ten degrees below zero .
it is not in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine .
on the other hand , in the Mon@@ tes Me@@ vi@@ ic Mon@@ gs , snow is almost 30 centimetres .
in some places , visibility was still bad because of the fog , according to information from the region &apos;s operating control centre .
the early R@@ 6 and the first @-@ class road in the region are now without restrictions .
however , caution is being recommended , especially in some bridges whose surface area may be frozen and slippery .
similarly , all second and third categories , including mountain roads , are also feasible .
in some of these , however , there are still stretches of ice and snow melting .
we need to increase attention on the road , especially in the larger areas .
the region of Par@@ hesitation and H@@ radar K@@ res@@ lo@@ le
on some roads in Bohemia , there is a danger of dust , and in higher areas , and in the mountains of the mountains , the road board is reported on the roads .
road operators warn drivers about the danger that ice plates will be formed , especially in higher areas in the Par@@ hesitate region .
there may be waves in the vicinity of Lan@@ š@@ k@@ ro@@ a , the United States , Po@@ li@@ č@@ ky , S@@ á@@ í@@ lia or V@@ y@@ so@@ é@@ k@@ é@@ o M@@ um@@ ta , and above all on second and third @-@ class roads .
roads I / 43 and I / 34 in S@@ am@@ ford have been dealt with in a poisonous fashion .
there are snow in particular on the roads of the Kr@@ k@@ on@@ š@@ i mountains to Or@@ ar@@ k@@ é Hory .
there is a hot layer of snow in the highest roads in the municipalities of the Ry@@ ch@@ ov n@@ ad ž@@ no@@ ai@@ no@@ u and Truth .
in the East Bohemia area , the sky will now be between clear and partially blurred , without rainfall .
temperatures , usually , between three and zero , and a positive degree , will weigh a weak wind .
Pilate region
the roads in the Pilate region are achievable today morning , even though caution will have to be stepped up and it will be necessary to adapt in time .
in the early hours of the morning , there will be dust , temperatures will vary between three and nine degrees below zero .
after the mess and the subsequent decline in temperatures , some routes could also be covered by ice .
in some places , drivers will find themselves in fog , but the visibility will be progressively improved .
that is what emerges from the information from the area of border operations in the region .
the D@@ 5 motorway is almost without restrictions , although it is recommended to be extremely careful , especially on the road between the 1980s and 131 .
the surface of most of the first @-@ class roads is dry and un@@ ice .
in the area of the road map of Pilate and T@@ ach@@ ov border with Germany , there may be tranches with ice plates .
the second and third categories are wetlands , and so in this case , too , there are sections of ice .
the drivers should be more prudent , especially in the less packed ways in the K@@ u@@ m@@ va area .
a region of O@@ lo@@ mo@@ es
in part , the drivers who go to the highest areas of the region of O@@ lo@@ mo@@ els will find themselves in snow in part .
after the chemical treatment , it was still snow in the port of Č@@ er@@ ven@@ o@@ le@@ sk@@ é and in the direction of V@@ id@@ el@@ sk@@ el@@ sk@@ el@@ sk@@ í@@ lia .
road operators took snow during the night ; on the road of Kat@@ u@@ per , some three centimetres of snow were accumulated , according to the managers of the tracks .
in the rest of the region , most of the roads are without restrictions .
&quot; in the higher areas of the road of K@@ us@@ per per , snow remains .
the drivers in the port of Č@@ er@@ v@@ o@@ sk@@ sk@@ é will find themselves in the middle in the direction of J@@ en@@ k J@@ en@@ k , &quot; he has now confirmed an operator of the airport administration of K@@ u@@ per per the Č@@ T@@ K .
on the ground and at night , the Christ was also born of its colleagues and , after chemical treatment , the paths of the highest areas are now clear and moved .
on the road in O@@ lo@@ mo@@ a , the routes , without any restrictions , in the case of Cecilia B@@ ur@@ en drivers , should lead to caution in the forest sections , where the roads are still water .
Y@@ ad Labour region and a region of Liberty
road operators in northern Bohemia have reported on complications in different sections at first hour of the morning .
apart from some of the places where it has healed or ice , according to police data on the mountain road between T@@ n@@ ol@@ ce and K@@ n@@ n@@ ice in the Kingdom of the Kingdom of England is closed down .
temperatures are kept below zero , even in the lowest areas , and the ice and snow obviously remain in the cold . instead , in the lowest areas , especially in the south @-@ east of the central Czech power , there are no problems , and the roads are generally dry .
there have been no complications in the service .
the road operators have warned of the ice presence in the surrounding areas of Kat@@ t@@ us@@ é .
according to the weather , the conditions have been ideal during the night . during the day , rain and snow are expected to be melting and at night the sky will be clear and ice .
on the basis of general roads , unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I and 13 , at the border between the Nor@@ ad Labour region and Liberty .
the road between Basel and K@@ n@@ ni@@ ce had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been archaeological on the road with the weight of snow .
Ki@@ on Or@@ n@@ est : we want to accumulate positive energy at our concerts .
it is said that in little less than a month the world is going to reach an end , what is your view on this ?
it is only one of many other alarmist reports that we like to grasp .
we like to make a joke about this and we like to say that we are the only group of music in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it .
moreover , in December , they organised a truly original project : three concerts against the end of the world .
can you explain it to our readers ?
this is a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art act that we have been planning for two years .
we decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the final timetable for 21 December at 11 a.m.
the day before , on 20 December at 9 p.m. , we will organise three simultaneous concerts in Prague , Br@@ no and O@@ st@@ va .
they will end up to about the same time that the fifth timetable is ending in the Rospuda island in the Pacific Ocean , 12 hours ahead of our time area .
who was this idea ?
initially it was my idea , then we were forging the project together with our Hon@@ za Au@@ za Au@@ za .
in addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world , we also want to reflect , along with society , on the state in which we will leave the world to our children .
on the occasion of the end of the fifth timetable , we have also created a single collection of items : di@@ bles , T @-@ shirts , stock exchanges and the original call for an end to the world that can be purchased at www.@@ e @-@ plug - another way of supporting us .
the T@@ PA T@@ PA group , along with other interpreters , also claimed the so @-@ called anthem against the end of the world , which is entitled &quot; F@@ in the world , cancelled . &quot;
is it currently very popular on YouTube , can you listen to the beneficial concerts ?
of course , and will be the last , well , as long as it is all right and the world does not end .
all the interpreters will be shouting at the same time in the three concerts .
anthems will be linked to each other by the special broadcasting in direct in the Czech Television .
the letter of this song has been written by Tom@@ os Han@@ pol , and interprets the leading role of Jesus in football , where it is also channelled through X@@ ind@@ l X ...
how did this collaboration come about ?
we work together even with other figures on the Czech cultural scene , apart from organising many beneficial and concerts ...
we are making every effort to take part in this project .
most of them have been shown to be in the interest , and I am happy to work with us .
what will be spent on the money collected at the concerts against the end of the world ?
to equipment for the school @-@ free education centre , which we carry out in its sixth consecutive year with the civil partnership T@@ PA in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ ford hard .
school students at J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ i@@ st@@ st@@ st@@ stan regularly receive the student visit with which they perform interesting and interesting activities .
pupils do not have sufficient financial resources to pay for teachers and we are forcing or to make it possible .
within the framework of the completion of the works in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ v@@ č@@ ov , there will be an independent building that we will be moving to this project .
several groups and interpreters are active in every concert .
what are the selection criteria ?
we try to produce a programme that is attractive to all generations , including children .
for example , in Prague it will act Ch@@ in@@ as@@ ki , Su@@ p@@ port Lesotho , I@@ rains , with Dan B@@ ár@@ ta , The T@@ PA T@@ PA , Mari@@ án B@@ go and Ji@@ ř@@ í Su@@ ch@@ ý .
in order to obtain more detailed information , you can consult www.@@ k@@ g@@ k@@ .@@ cz@@ .@@ cz@@ .
will any other &quot; spectacular action &quot; be planned in the future ?
in May , for the first time , we will be acting in the Istanbul festival , and so here we will certainly be preparing an attractive programme with interesting guests .
next year we would also like to touch on the Queen National Hall of New York , and I personally , taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States , would like to complete it with action in Washington and Chicago .
your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist , so far you have acted for example in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
the T@@ PA T@@ PA , however , is a group of people with disabilities .
what is the logistics and organisation of these journeys ?
it is not so difficult how it might appear at first sight .
there are five members on the electric wheels , the chairs should be travelling on the baggage of baggage and we are also taking a great deal of weight , the boxes with the instruments ...
however , so far we have managed to do it well : Č@@ SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared , and I am very surprised at that .
even in Moscow , where we returned recently , everything went out of trouble .
thanks to the exit from abroad , you can compare the different attitudes of society to the disabled and other aspects .
what have you been finding up to now ?
in Madrid , Luxembourg , London , and other cities , everything works better than here ; in Russia we have seen that , in the east , there is a long way to go .
unlike Prague , Moscow is full of barriers , there it is still not often the case that one person is moving alone in the city centre in an electrical @-@ wheeled chair .
something as common as someone in the wheelchair should be given preference in lift , there it is not .
fortunately , a civil partnership has been set up which is endeavouring to raise the problems of people with disabilities .
where do we have to take an example from more developed countries ?
there are many aspects to which we are behind ...
it is important to mention , however , that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people to which it is directly affected .
in London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disability should be relocated on their own in public and can go to the service , the museum , where they want ...
but it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life , in this regard , with The T@@ PA T@@ PA , we are a little ahead !
a society that respects or without barriers is one thing , but when the time comes when eminent sportsmen , artists , actors , politicians or lawyers will emerge , it will start to change all the truth .
so far , these are isolated cases of people who have a great determination of will .
the T@@ PA T@@ PA group is currently very popular , but if we look back a few years ago , what did the group join in 1998 ?
I came as a nurse in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ t@@ ag@@ ov , where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to spend something .
and since I am a media , I am one of the people who , among others , founded an amateur group with a colleague of work .
and , over time , as our Moderate @-@ in @-@ the @-@ battle to Angel@@ o@@ ria says , we were a bit of our hands ( laughter ) .
however , the popularity did not arrive until the last few years - or I am mistaken .
it is true that we were very much helped by the fact that we were famous and also actively working to promote the group .
we come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist .
thanks to European Union aid , we can also afford quality teachers , equipment , etc .
do you intend to go so far with The T@@ PA T@@ PA ?
from the outset I saw the potential that had to be done in another way .
the spectacle world is full of things that resemble each other .
it is logical , in its own way , that everything new is taken with caution and it takes a long time to accept .
there are few extraordinary things , but I dare to say that The T@@ PA T@@ PA is one of them .
the impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion is a natural reaction ...
but compassion is completely superfluous , because people with disabilities are not abandoned creatures and of whom we should have sympathy .
there are people who are able to live a full life and development , with the condition , of course , that they have the necessary resources .
I always say that if there is any thing for people with disabilities , then it is not just progress for them , but for the whole of society .
did he help the fact that he is a demanding chief , as many people describe it ?
if we want to do quality work , we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline .
I think that is completely normal .
some people arrive in a romantic vision and , in the clouds , and when they were told that they have to go to test two days to test , go to the preparatory test , and spend a long time travelling , and in concerts , the initial euphoria would leave them quickly .
but that is how it works everywhere , in every group that wants to work and achieve something .
today , the T@@ PA T@@ PA group has 20 members .
how many of them were already at the beginning of 1998 ?
we have only one thing to say : we must be able to take the lead in the case of Angel@@ o@@ ria .
we are an open group , people enter and they come , and cannot be avoided .
anyone who is willing and willing will always find the doors open .
it will be the day of the late end of the world , on Thursday , 12 hours , at 21 a.m.
it will take place in the Prague In@@ g@@ g@@ g@@ g@@ a , in Br@@ no and P@@ y@@ no@@ j@@ em in O@@ st@@ va and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic .
the three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through video conferences to pick together the song of the T@@ PA T@@ PA &apos;s T@@ PA , cancelled .
the aim of the concert is to gather the resources required to finance multifunctional education of the education centre without the T@@ U@@ DE@@ O in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ i@@ č@@ ov in Prague , the cost of which amounts to EUR 25 million .
entry to the concert of concert costs 400 C@@ Z@@ K , and children up to 12 years are available for free entry into the early sale option in the Internet .
Poland and the cosmo@@ s .
at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week , Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA ; it is the second member country of the ESA of the former Eastern European bloc , after the Czech Republic , which became a full member on 12 November 2008 .
Poland started intensive cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years it took part in the agency &apos;s committee of projects .
however , Poland &apos;s path towards the cosmo@@ s began long before .
Polish enthusiasts have already spent flying on space before World War II , although they did not always understand their work .
I would remind you , for example , of the conference of A. Kat@@ n@@ feld in the Warsaw astronomical Observatory , in which , on 6 December 1933 , it presented its ideas on the pioneering study &quot; In@@ tro@@ p to the mon@@ om@@ tics . &quot;
the ideas of the young engineer ( born of 1905 ) left the assistants indifferent , and , years later , CALIFORNIA was reminded that Dr Jan G@@ om@@ ski had been the only one that had been interested in his work .
in France , in France , the Robert E@@ E@@ n@@ n@@ ot @-@ Peltier prize was awarded in France , and André @-@ Marie Louis Hirsch for its &quot; In@@ tro@@ w to the mon@@ i@@ tics . &quot;
Dr Jan G@@ are@@ ski ( 18@@ 99 - 1966 ) , mentioned earlier , became a great driver of the mega @-@ omy and mono@@ li@@ tics .
he published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline .
G@@ om@@ ski became a mono@@ li@@ tic promoter , known around the world , and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put to one of the dark side of the moon .
in Poland the year 19@@ 25 was built into a d@@ as@@ ina , which was to be provided by a rocket engine .
unfortunately , we do not know who the proposal was , and we are not aware of the draft .
it is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used for the grubbing @-@ up of the Dalits or for its brake .
information on this release is limited to the collection in the press of the time .
from the year 1933 Polish artillery began to devote itself to the missiles .
the research was funded by the K@@ om@@ lia Technology Agency , which was carried out in collaboration with the people of the European Union , a country which has been able to do so .
on the basis of retained material , it is clear that research has reached the stage of practical tests .
however , with the arrival of German troops , research was interrupted .
in 1937 , there was a prototype in the specialised press of the prototype of an electric @-@ hunt missile designed by the engineer Ro@@ ho@@ z@@ emi , and the following year was published in the study &quot; R@@ ak@@ i@@ p - Tri@@ p@@ p@@ d@@ c@@ ar@@ z@@ ar@@ z@@ na i ra@@ ki@@ e@@ y@@ ba Lo@@ n@@ z@@ za &quot; , from the L@@ eli@@ wa @-@ Kr@@ z@@ y@@ w@@ l@@ ki author .
both projects were aimed at the military use of engines for missiles .
soon before the war , the interim scientific advisory committee ( T@@ m@@ cz@@ ag@@ en@@ w@@ y and Mr D@@ au@@ k@@ ow@@ y ) took the project of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all the work .
the committee was founded in 1937 , but after two years of activity , it was interrupted by the start of the war .
other research @-@ related studies appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Italian Polish Society of astronau@@ tics ( Pol@@ ha@@ e T@@ ow@@ ar T@@ ow@@ ri@@ w@@ or A@@ es@@ on@@ eg@@ y@@ cz@@ ne ) .
it refers to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronomical astronomical in November 1954 of the magazine magazine .
in one of them , a society that was intended to take up a society that would be devoted to the mon@@ au@@ tics was proposed .
artificial satellite projects were already under way at the time , and it was obvious that the self @-@ in research was a future discipline .
from the beginning of 1956 , the astronau@@ tics Society ( P@@ TA ) sought to form part of the 1951 International Federation ( founded in 1951 ) , and in the autumn of that year the P@@ TA became a full member .
the next year , the first president of the P@@ TA , Kazakhstan CITY ( 19@@ 02 - 1959 ) has become the vice @-@ president of the International Federation of astronau@@ tics .
he played his job up to his death in 1959 .
starting from 1956 , the P@@ TA played a significant part in the development of the RT@@ M rocket rocket ( R@@ ak@@ i@@ p Me@@ e@@ o@@ lo@@ o@@ cz@@ na ) , which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out .
the first type R@@ M @-@ 1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time on 10 October 1958 .
the rocket had a 1 800 metres boom , some 80 mm in length and did not reach the five kg of weight .
it was later built to build the R@@ M @-@ 1A version , and in the summer of 1959 , the two @-@ stage rocket tests in the B@@ ł@@ bert desert desert began .
the rocket rocket was 1.4 metres and catches around 1@@ 1.5 kg .
another type of development rocket was going to be the subject of real scientific study ; the R@@ M @-@ 34 rocket was going to have a peak of 14@@ .5 km , and its mission would be to control the wind of the wind .
in 1962 , however , the work was suspended .
the successor to the former R@@ M rockets was the Me@@ e@@ or 1 rocket , which was built during the 1962 and 1965 years .
it was designed as a two @-@ stage rocket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 kg and an initial weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg .
three types were developed ( called Me@@ e@@ or 1A , 1@@ B and - 1@@ C ) , which differed among themselves by the space available for scientific equipment .
in the Me@@ e@@ or 1A rocket , the space available to the volume was 0.4 litres , in the Me@@ e@@ or 1@@ B @-@ 1@@ B of 0.@@ 34 litres and in the Me@@ e@@ or 1@@ 0@@ 0.@@ 62 @-@ 1@@ c .
the maximum boom in the three types was 37 km .
between the years 1965 and 1968 it took place at the Air Institute , the Me@@ e@@ or 2 rocket , whose first airlines began in October 1970 .
the Me@@ e@@ or 2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to take a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km .
then the Me@@ e@@ or 2@@ H and M@@ e@@ or 3 version was built .
there is also a need to mention the entry of Poland into the CO@@ SP@@ R , Research , Research year , in 1960 , and to the formation of the National CO@@ SP@@ R Committee two years later .
within the framework of the Inter@@ k@@ os@@ us programme , Poland joined the research of the witch @-@ space on artificial Soviet satellites and , in 1978 , the Polish pilot look Her@@ z@@ z@@ ren@@ ski turned into the second mono@@ mon@@ mon@@ ta after J@@ im@@ op@@ r R@@ áil .
suspending the law on social work is not the solution .
last week , the constitutional trial suspended social garlic law .
the resolution raised a heated discussion in society .
it will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view .
liberal economic systems in the EU , as in the globalised world , are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation .
as a result , this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict .
the cause is in the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital , along with unbridled financial speculation .
the impact of big differences in the labor cost ( of wages ) leads to economic tensions .
under this concept , it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer , with the import of cheap goods , is trying to shorten distances and for this &apos; causes a lower level of the price of the competitor with the aim of getting the majority of the market and thereby increasing its profit margins .
on a large scale it means , for the majority of entrepreneurs , moving production abroad , buying cheaper or disappearing , and the result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour , compared to other economies , is higher .
because private capital has no social responsibility and , thus , it is also not responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon generates , it necessarily increases the social spending of the state .
this whole situation leads to the total lack of interest by employers for paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage that they have caused in their pursuit of profit .
the situation is universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data .
the ill @-@ informed practices of private capital create situations , in certain economies , where the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country .
in other words , governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline .
this is particularly true in the changes to the laws in force .
the aim is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital , especially where wages are concerned .
this takes place , on the one hand , by the system of economic obligations in the case of long @-@ term unemployment ; on the other , through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights .
the result is growing poverty along with the increase in the gap between rich and poor .
for a number of years , there have been points of food delivery in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work .
the number of people receiving this type of aid is already at a million .
in the context of an increase in the competitiveness of the German economy , there is a fairly frequent case : people employed at such a low rate that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive .
a scandal of this kind was made public with the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament .
the savings measures in practically all the EU &apos;s southern states lead , without a doubt , to the same situation : people , lobbied by a deep @-@ rooted decline in their social level , are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century , or to live with a poor wage at the limit of society , hoping that one day will reach the country &apos;s private investor capital .
is it necessary to ask where it comes from ?
in the event of other EU countries , poverty passes from one country to another or never comes from , as Chinese , Indians , Brazilians , Turks , Moroccans , Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny proportion of European wages .
this also affects the whole of Latin America .
liberal theories and the media claim that the state should not bring capital into the economy , which the economy leads to its failure .
the claim that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering in control is tooth and nail .
next , we need to ask ourselves whether private capital does not affect its self @-@ interest in political progress , and hence the state as a whole .
in this case the answer is clearly yes .
the test is the existence of lobbies , in the very powerful and ubiquitous practice , in all states .
the result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption , mutual favors , in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable .
in Germany , the situation is as follows : state ministries , lacking financial resources , are drawing up draft law to private legal companies , which are often linked to industry .
such law @-@ making projects are then adopted in the Bundestag , the German parliament .
in this way , all power is not from the people , as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies , but from strong financial groups that represent their own interests .
it is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly found in a situation of how the Roman crisis in the Roman republic in the days of Caesar describes our work : &quot; the state had stagnated , and the administrations were in the grip of force . &quot;
in return for bribes , favours obtained , and help to finance stones or dams .
bribery and corruption spread without any impediment , and people went on to the ballot box in advance &quot; ... &quot; there were no people who would aspire to a post in the administration , so once , because of this disarray , the state was eight months without lecturing them &quot; - &quot; With serious talk that the only remedy to such a serious situation was autocracy , and that a strong man was needed ... &quot; though he had been forced to choose , Caesar rose to power , and transformed democracy into power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy .
the conclusion , just as in ancient times , is that today &apos;s society is based on un@@ considered preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests .
private capital is not in its essence capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole of society .
the result is the same as that of then , a decline in the unprecedented elite , without making an effort to reform it in depth .
the causes of the boom in fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
with respect for the current situation , it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in the interests of a liberal @-@ style democracy , as a defined pause , pending the next coup .
the truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignore the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed , as well as crimes against humanity , as we know them in ancient and most recent history .
suspending the law on public procurement is not the solution - at least not in the long term .
under pressure from economic competition , both internationally and within the EU , the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for other ways of reducing the population &apos;s social level .
this trend is therefore systemic .
the solution is through concrete socio @-@ political reforms , which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken private capital &apos;s monopoly position in society for the benefit of the state .
Israel : the laboratory of chaos .
&quot; that is a record of breach of the violence , and nothing could be done . and nothing could be done . he says that he is not able to do so , and he says &quot; L@@ et &apos;@@ L@@ et does not allow us to be &quot; ( we do not forget how fragile we are ) . &quot;
&quot; if my children did not want wars , there would be no &quot; Gu@@ tel@@ e Sch@@ n@@ er , the wife of Mayer Am@@ sch@@ el Roth @-@ d , on his death bed in 18@@ 49 .
after the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip , they have , as always , emerged from a variety of reactions .
one , on the Israeli side , argues in favour of the right to self @-@ defense and bow to the Palestinians in the role of terrorists , the other supports Palestinians , and claims racism by the state of Israel , genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs , and describing Israel as a terrorist state .
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the regularly repeated killings and who is the victim . after all , today &apos;s citizens of Israel , including the self @-@ employed territories , were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence .
my intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain , a look to find out who will take advantage of the tensions that have been going on for 95 years - calculated from the Bal@@ four statement in November 1917 - in a small area of the Middle East .
some of my considerations are based on historical facts , others in conclusions that I have arrived at on the basis of my own way of understanding the issue , about who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history .
in the history of humanity the history of power struggles is in the forefront .
at each time we are able to find an Alexander Mag@@ no or Napoleon .
but what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who pushed their steps in an autonomous way , or whether they were behind his craft , who led his actions to a certain target .
we have to accept that we live at a time when the world &apos;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies , has not been achieved in a single generation .
among these astronomical families highlights one that could be regarded as the most prominent ( if there is still someone behind him , I do not know , but I do not rule out ) : the Roth @-@ ard .
there is little talk about them .
of course .
in the 1990 &quot; s , they bought the first news agency to stop linking their name with very serious criminal acts of power and wealth , or both , which , for them , always meant strengthening .
they have significant shares in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented , a war has been declared , or is being prepared : before the attack on Afghanistan , after Iraq was an attack 5 , after overthrowing Gaddafi , only four were left , but Russia has meanwhile subject the central bank to the Russian government .
anyone who has tried to oppose this family has been killed .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank of the Central Bank of the Pri@@ sch@@ il@@ d &apos;s central bank , it began during the War of S@@ ve@@ a printing money and was murdered in 18@@ 65 in the theatre .
J@@ F@@ K began to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system ( EDF ) , and was murdered in 1963 ; Senator Louis McMillan F@@ ad@@ den was poisoned the year 1936 after wanting to call on the EDF for triggering the major economic crisis of 1929 .
his zeal for world power led to them during the 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to chart a plan with three world wars , designed by Albert Pi@@ ke Ma@@ ke , with the rate of 33 .
the first war was aimed at eliminating the large mono@@ onic states across Europe ; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy , especially in Britain , and the third was to reduce the population &apos;s population between half a million and a billion people ( such as slaves for their welfare and luxury ) would be sufficient , and will not consume so many resources ) , as well as the creation of a universal religion ( equ@@ men@@ ism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution ) and the final adoption of absolute powers .
the working method of the richest family group , together with the IPCC , follows the dynamics of crisis meltdown and the subsequent offer of a solution ( ord@@ er ab ) - order on the basis of chaos .
however , these solutions are wrong , and they always lead to a worsening of the situation ; if not , it is sufficient to recall that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as the 19@@ 07 crisis was not repeated .
so , after the success of the heir to the Austro @-@ Hungarian menu , Francis Fernando , in Sarajevo , and after the First World War came to an end , beat ist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik Revolution .
the First World War , in military and economic terms , ended in a sudden and unjustified way , the capitulation of Germany ( the wars to put an end to the ist Russia were unnecessary ) and the subsequent break @-@ up of Central Europe , the Austrian @-@ Hungarian empire .
in order to prepare the ground for World War II , it allowed bankers and politicians to create a contentious situation in the wake of the huge war repairs imposed on Germany , creating the best conditions for the radicalisation of the impoverished masses , which was strong enough and simple enough to serve the guilty , and then build an Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that was supposed to represent the role of the fifth column , which was so well the role of the fifth column , which ranked the flame and provoked the outbreak of war .
at the end of the nineteenth century , the Roth@@ sch@@ d promoted the founding of the Zionist movement , a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state , preferably in the region of the former Roma as capital ( return to Si@@ ion ) .
the previously stated statement laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place .
there were terrorist attacks on both sides .
the Second World War broke out : it is hard to know whether Hitler has gone too far from the string that international bankers had , or if all that he did was part of a plan , but the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society .
Israel was officially founded in 1948 , similarly to the way in which the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II , with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus of a third war .
if international bankers were to pursue it , the Jewish nation , like the Second World War , would become the victim of the first line of combat , now together with the Arab , or generally Muslim , population of the Middle East .
Israel is an immense laboratory , a power station and chaos , not only in the context of its country , but also at international level .
who is guilty , and who is the victim in the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict , where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence , if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their quest for world power ?
at this point it is necessary to distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders , because , as in our country , international bankers only present their candidates in the elections .
Israel &apos;s current president B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician , loyal to international bankers , who does everything possible to declare war on Iran , and , considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan ... ) , it would threaten to become a global conflict , and , if we bear in mind that Iran controls the Strait of Or@@ mu@@ z , where 20 % of all world oil ( the navigation corridor has only two @-@ miles ) , would lead to the destruction of the world economy .
under what light now are the words that David Ransdorf said in 1994 : &quot; the only thing we need is a general crisis , and people will agree with a new world order . &quot;
the new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves .
a world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well @-@ managed financial economy .
a world in which every individual new individual is put off a chip to the birth that controls everything .
&apos;@@ and forces everyone , small and large , rich and poor , free and slave , to have a brand on the right hand or in the front , not to be able to buy or sell unless they take the name of this monster or the figures on their behalf .
it is necessary to understand this : anyone who has two fingers at the forefront , who will add to the numbers of this monster .
the number marks the person , and this number is six hundred and sixty @-@ six . &quot;
film Ar@@ go : if you get crude , you call in Hollywood
in November 1979 , a group of Islamist students held the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage .
his release was going to be in exchange for the de@@ ha@@ h Mohamed P@@ ag@@ za P@@ á@@ le@@ vi , who after the revolution fled to the US , a country that had sponsored its regime for decades .
the situation did not offer any positive prospects for the American administration : throwing the baby out could not be allowed to happen , since , if it did , it threatened the confidence of its allies in other countries .
but the release of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution had led to the theocratic regime , was not at its disposal .
it was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which subsequently intensified even more with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force .
imprisoned diplomats were released 4@@ 44 days after the Algerian government &apos;s negotiating intervention .
in the US , its fate caused a wave of solidarity and encouragement against Iran .
the failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter &apos;s defeat in the run @-@ up to the 1980 presidential elections .
the film &quot; Ar@@ go &quot; of the Governor and actor Ben Paris feared a episode in this history , which found a small success for America .
shortly before the embassy , six employees were escaped from the building .
after a complicated event , they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy .
the CIA , working with the Canadian authorities , managed to get them out of Iran , in order to contribute a covert story : they went on to Canadian passports , as members of the film team that looked at the location in the country for the running of a science @-@ fiction super@@ production .
combination of gender
the plan drawn up by the expert in &quot; ex@@ leakage &quot; T@@ uc@@ i Minor required Hollywood &apos;s collaboration .
in order for the lie to appear truthful , it was written on the film project in specialist magazines , organised press conferences , the fictitious production society even had real office .
the details of the operation were kept secret for a long time , the film has been made on the basis of the memories of Tony Minor .
the film in Afghanistan is a unique combination of a number of genders .
on the one hand , a realistic political dream , on the other , a so @-@ called &quot; catch , &quot; the story of an episode that went well , a deception ( one example may be the series of States ) .
in the film , the mood is combined , and we find ourselves with a well @-@ documented sequences of Tehran , and in the sequence of appropriations , there are a number of flagship photographs of the time of events , which were reflected in the film in the same way ; there are not much differences in this regard .
on the other hand , scenes typical of Hollywood a more light @-@ out , marked by irony and slight exaggeration .
and , moreover , scenes from the CIA &apos;s headquarters and other institutions : senior men who analyse the situation at the negotiating table , in the corridors of the office , by telephone ...
Ben Paris has managed to restart his career in an excellent way .
the actor , which had been ridiculed , has become a respectable director , and its way of acting is no longer the target of ironic comments .
ARGO is its third , post @-@ a @-@ small @-@ old shop , after 2007 and the th@@ ri@@ ler &quot; The T@@ ow@@ n city of thieves &quot; ( 2010 ) .
at the same time , it is the first Afghan film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston , where it was raised .
likewise , the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed directors of old films above Hollywood standards .
and Afghanistan shows it in Ar@@ go , where Tehran is &quot; wheel &quot; in Canada .
the best scenes of the film are on the streets , in the reconstruction of honest events : the opening sequence of the embassy &apos;s taking is impressive in its light capacity , which will , at the same time , convey the emotion of the confusion and lack of foresight that arises when history takes us a step forward somewhere .
Afghanistan and its collaborators have a similar effect on the fictitious scenes ( the impersonal team in the bazaar of Tehran ) .
too much action in too many places
the director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the movie sense of the most intriguing scenes .
and it manages quite well , and sometimes it adds something to reality : there is no such elegant thing here - the scene in which the crisis is looming at Tehran &apos;s airport , the deviation from a call to America and the unbridled pursuit of its route become crazy .
Ar@@ go &apos;s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places .
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Sovereignty have a very amusing role as Hollywood collaborators , even though their characters deserved more space and are , far from it , the only ones in this film .
for these reasons , the film in Afghanistan loses a bit of dramatic shock , but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest , assessing its realisation , and the re@@ configuration of a &quot; th@@ ri@@ ler &quot; that it evokes for the 1970 &quot; s .
but it will be difficult to collapse .
just as the question of a real history and evidence of how exaggerated the notions of all @-@ in @-@ presence and all the intelligence of the secret services can be , it is enough .
rule @-@ of @-@ globalists , bananas , and the circus
the www.@@ ban@@ kov@@ ni@@ p@@ p@@ t@@ .com server , which each year presents a survey on the most absurd banking rates , has now decided to announce the contest on &quot; the EU &apos;s &quot; regulation or the most absurd ideas . &quot;
&quot; we were after the last event , the EU intends to adopt a 40 % share of women in leadership in big European companies , &quot; explained P@@ rou@@ vo Patri@@ k N@@ ach@@ er , the survey &apos;s organizing .
the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women is one example .
until now , women were in the best position of better prices in living insurance , because they represent objectively a minor risk .
&quot; other incredible ideas of the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year . &quot;
the election will take place at the end of February 2013 , &quot; reported N@@ ach@@ er .
among the controversial EU regulations is , for example , the compulsory addition of bio@@ components to fuel , which , as a result , damages the environment ; another ban is the use of mercury &apos;s mercury @-@ wide mercury only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline the size of battery cages , which has contributed to a considerable increase in the price of eggs this year .
there has been criticism of the actual ban on using the expression &apos; butter of one &apos; or the withdrawal of the classical light light of shops .
a high @-@ quality banana must be 14 centimetres long .
the EU apparatus takes such decisions often under pressure from one commercial or industrial lobby , whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states ( the Czech Republic , even with the threat of veto , claiming the demands of its banks ) .
the interests of a lobby were behind the request , for example , that higher @-@ quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimetres in the EU and could not present &quot; abnormal treatments . &quot;
the European Commission defended itself by saying that it seeks only to harmonise the non @-@ homogen@@ ised national rules to date , which only complicated their marketing .
the rules that make reference to fruit and vegetables in the EU , despite opposition from some states , have been watered down on the basis that the existing directive entails waste of food .
the candidate to win the survey could be the EU &apos;s prescription of last year according to which it is compulsory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not authorised to inflate them without the supervision of an adult .
the US referred here to an American study according to which , when it comes to toys , globalization is the main cause of death by drowning .
a similar restriction applicable to the use of rape by children of up to 14 years is also in force .
unusual stories are even born in our country
equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials : anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia , not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece .
the B@@ as@@ z@@ en@@ p@@ p@@ t@@ .com server , in collaboration with the laissez @-@ faire liberal economists , nominated in the survey , among some absurd proposals mentioned above , the Union &apos;s prescription for the volume of food provisions in the territory of a Member State .
the EU identified the maximum volumes of food provision that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU .
then , the Czech Republic exceeded , for example , the volume set for mushrooms in retains , a threat of substantial fine .
the organisers of the survey were also interested in how to pay out those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting subsidies for the application of subsidies .
such ideas did not arise in Brussels , but in Prague .
&quot; we are at a disadvantage by the fact that we do not have a sea .
we asked the European Union for compensation , &quot; declared , in the autumn of 2004 , the then the Prime Minister of Agriculture ( Č@@ S@@ D ) at the time of 2004 .
it was argued with the fact that much grain was produced in our country and , as a result of so @-@ called purchases of intervention , the state had the stores full and had to be exported .
according to notice , given that the Czech Republic is far from sea ports , the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros .
in the end , the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea .
the subsidy to receive a subsidy was proposed to municipalities by the public prosecutor for local development led by the Minister of Minister P@@ iz N@@ áil ( US @-@ D@@ U ) , in particular , aimed at writing applications from Brussels .
EU : rare prescriptions are an exception
the guidelines of the Member States are often a matter of criticism , the EU &apos;s efforts in terms of regulations , and more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve more , according to various experts , to our recognition .
according to the experts , the most serious problem is , for example , the recovery of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration , but which the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations .
the Czechs also touch the sensitive fibre , in the same way as other countries in the Union , the fight for the right to designation of origin of their traditional products , although our country has not always been victorious from these struggles .
the Czechs , after six years of disputes with the Germans and Austrians , successfully defended the designation of origin of the O@@ lo@@ mo@@ a &apos;s re @-@ heading , but they had to change the name to national rum , whose tradition in our country goes back to the nineteenth century , and went on to be called &quot; tu@@ z@@ em@@ va . &quot;
only products drawn up from a sugar cane ban can be known as rum , but not those that have been made from sugar beet .
on the official list of protected designations of origin in the EU , along with the so @-@ called m@@ as@@ w and fat wave around the world , the tidal wave of the German city in the nineteenth @-@ check German city , or Parma ham , for example , are already found in the galleries of Kar@@ ward and V@@ is@@ y , the Po@@ ho@@ cz@@ ice load of Po@@ ho@@ cz@@ ce and T@@ ř@@ board , and even the variety of hops .
as a protected river of the EU , they will be able to be proud of the bread and veal of Par@@ ch@@ ce and the Ho@@ te@@ ri@@ ice bu@@ k@@ on@@ k@@ o@@ š@@ í mo@@ ri@@ os .
people want them to save the republic , but I am an amateur , claims Lesotho
Mr Senator , how were the elections to be put before the President ?
it is not a matter of being a senator or a president .
if we were not all well in our country , then I would not be eligible .
but I am no longer able to see how the past 20 years are stolen in our country , how the thieves go unpunished , taxes and retirement age are increased .
he had no ambition to be political .
when I see something that I do not like , I try to make a solution to change it .
since I have already 40 years and my candidacy is independent , the only possibility I have of changing things is to stand as a senator or president .
the Senate has already arrived , but soon after it has been on the way to the presidency .
is it not turning our backs on those people who voted for it ?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on results in the Senate elections .
I know that if he was elected as a senator , I would be asking the presidency .
but my goal is not the role ; the role is the tool with which I can make my own ideas reality .
that is why I need the strongest possible influence and the strongest mandate .
the problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticise in the bar of television , but that we are trampling on anyone who wants to start a change .
this is added to the media , which will discredit them and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie .
I have been told that I have acquitted journalists or that I have been an advisor to Ji@@ ř@@ í Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k .
we are going to talk about your ideas .
it is presented to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over 20 million .
this must change the law .
as President , he does not have this competence , and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws .
how does it want to solve it ?
as a citizen , I have been part of an lobbying group so that the guide trade is recognised as self @-@ employed , and we managed to do so .
the problem is in politics : if someone comes up with a good proposal , whether on the right or on the left , it is rejected , and that affects citizens .
as an independent candidate , I have greater potential for the support of all the parliamentary groups .
without any isolation or party dogma , I have the ability to choose something from every party that is better for our country and implement it .
is a right @-@ wing and left @-@ wing men more considered ?
from the Czech point of view , I have the impression that people consider me to be more of the left .
for me , it is not important , whether it is a bit left @-@ wing or a little right @-@ wing .
what matters to me is that we should move forward .
I do not care whether anyone is right or left @-@ wing , I want to unite people .
I always openly support any good solution , regardless of whether the proposal comes from the K@@ S@@ Č@@ M or the SDGs and , in the same way , I will be against the bad ideas .
you are a joke when you say , as a populist , that it is populist .
but is it not demonstrating what it says ?
when a business plan is created for the company , you also have certain objectives and ideals .
and you are trying to get them together .
there are those who call it populism , but all the proposals that I am talking about already work in the world or known experts talk about them .
but , without Parliament &apos;s support , you are only left slogans .
this cannot survive in long @-@ term policy .
or do you think that if you address people and talk to them , you will , for example , achieve criminal and financial responsibility ?
I have no other choice .
convincing politicians , journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve this .
if elected President , there would be no problem in organising a TV @-@ based broadcasting in which I would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimise criminal and financial responsibility for politicians , officials , judges , and state prosecutors .
and , eventually , they would have to communicate why they do not want it .
if there is a strong character pointing to the disputes , pressure can be put on the political scene .
let us take the President &apos;s direct choice , which has been an achievement of public pressure .
at the same time I say that I am only an amateur , I am neither a genius nor an intellectual .
to my views and ideals , I try to look for allies .
I have just started with the policy and I am trying to get the greatest possible support for my programme .
I am trying to take things forward myself , but if it is not going well , I will leave it in six years &apos; time and I will come back to the private sector .
it sounds a little bit as if the Czech Republic is trying to save the Czech Republic .
I am no rescue .
I know that I do not do anything with one person , which is why I have visited a number of well @-@ known figures , in the best way that they would be encouraged to submit their candidacy for the Senate .
I went to see Rad@@ im Janjaweed , but he refused because he had a lot of work .
I , for my part , was at least supported by the J@@ ana B@@ ana Lo@@ a &apos;s research journalist , which brought fraud into the light of fraud with light oil oils .
I tabled on the basis that people are really dissatisfied , now I am in the balance .
sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls and , those who did , voted to the establishment representatives .
in the Senate we are two of the independent sector .
people chose the Senate , so it will be difficult to make changes .
however , I will defend my own ideas , for example the direct choice of mayors or governors .
is it considering its own party ?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time to do that , to see how all the potential members of the party are talking about the past , and I do not have any money either .
I have no money or for the campaign for the presidency , in my transparent account only 20 000 .
is it not money ?
it talks about property claims , how is it your own ?
I think I am privately owned by some 60 million .
in Prague I have an area of an estimated 25 million , an estimated ten million , another eight million floor in eight million , a collection of art works with a value of ten million , a Martin of about 3.5 million , and a Kor@@ ko@@ da Dis@@ b valued at one million , and in the account I have a couple of millions .
by the way , I have a Martin , because it was my dream of youth , and I always liked James Bond , who was driving this car , to be blessed with women and , at the same time , fought against abuses and injustices .
is Mr Martin , his property , valued at 60 million and does not have any money for the campaign ?
he says that he wants to change the republic but does not want to put too much money from him .
it is not very convincing .
I do not have 15 million for the campaign .
do I have to borrow ?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign .
the fact that it has no sponsors shows that there is not much interest in my programme .
I do not have a duty to pay for the campaign with money from my own pocket .
the campaign expenditure essentially covers what I will receive in the term &apos; senator &apos;s pay &apos; .
but I could not live from that , for example , I could not pay my son the English school , which costs $ 30 per month .
if I would just like to make money , I would not be present as a candidate .
is he going to continue with his business activity in order to live ?
did he not say earlier that he was going to leave this business ?
this has nothing to do with higher pay .
as I have promised , I have partly left up my activities .
for example , the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in the spring .
people would like the Sam@@ ari@@ ar to save the republic .
but I too need to live from something .
how much is it customary to win monthly as an entrepreneur ?
between 200 000 and 400 000 , which I continue to gain .
if it were President , then it would leave business .
it is able to consult the whole of the interview in the Friday &apos;s edition of Saturday .
the M@@ V@@ D@@ V architecture study shows that true adventures are not only at the head - in the example of the library of S@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ Haram and the newly completed &quot; book mountain &quot; - 2 photos .
&quot; I think that the building is amusing , it has a visionary aspect , and there is , at long last , something interesting to see , &quot; says Lis@@ te Ver@@ ha@@ ong , a cross @-@ street crossing .
and the IT technique in a large company in the vicinity of the library points : &apos; moreover , the building is beautiful &apos; .
but I wonder why we need a library today .
we all have the Internet , tablets and electronic books .
no one is happy to be in these past fashion libraries , not ?
Se@@ j@@ Kenyans , a city of sleep on the gates of Rotterdam , which hardly deserves a quick visit , has the doubtful honour of having been put at a record to forget .
the population of 80 000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands .
in order to counteract this shameful situation , some years ago , it was decided to contribute to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear to be represented in euro notes in the form of a mini @-@ table mini @-@ concrete package .
the success of the educational offensive was limited .
and that was how the politicians decided that there was only a possibility to improve the statistics : a library had to be built .
Win@@ y Ma@@ as , the Dutch architecture study M@@ V@@ D@@ V , all a master in the art of the bar and responsible of buildings diverge to the couple that cynical , took the matter with his usual serenity and appeared in the presentation of the tender in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face .
and as long as the jury looked around and shrug , Ma@@ as ran books by size as a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words : &quot; dear fellow citizens :
here you have , my proposal for the mountain of books of Christ , the so @-@ called &quot; Bo@@ k@@ ney &apos;@@ . &quot;
nine years later , the mountains of EUR 30 million will be raised as planned .
this is part of the revitalisation project , which is complete with an underground parking car , a supermarket , a post office and a couple of houses of homes and viewers .
at the beginning of November , the mountain of books was awarded with the second prize &quot; B@@ est Li@@ br@@ ary of 2012 . &quot;
moreover , the project is also nominated for the &quot; National C@@ ch National W@@ od A@@ ward 2012 . &quot;
in this way , the little short city , which to date had nothing more to offer than a post @-@ modern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly city of the white façade whose white façade would be more of a central milk plant , now has a work of contemporary architecture .
but , above all , S@@ j@@ Kenyans now has the first public cultural building in his history .
the Long Road to the Book
the first impression is that it is a house of books under a penny .
it is true that there is a lift which keeps us right at the centre of the mountain , but the real @-@ keepers of space and reading do not use it , but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its escalation to the top .
the inner , easy @-@ to @-@ all and easy @-@ to @-@ cover @-@ to @-@ face approach , the soil of brick ground and the elegant lights unequivocally support the public status of the library .
the urban environment is perfect .
in the eyes of the banks of the park , dogs and children are seen to be seen to be perceived as playing football .
on all sides books , books and more books .
&quot; the shelves of books are usually prepared along the façade , and there is a huge dark chamber that usually is sometimes something uncomfortable and impersonal , &quot; claims Win@@ and Ma@@ as .
what we have done is to put the classic space of space on the top , and to draw the internal reading area from outside .
the inside of the mountain is very well used : the offices are in the offices , the Internet library , the chess club , the environmental education centre and the maintenance room .
special mention is due to the black shelves which take the role of fat functions in the same breath as for the same time .
in the light of the day , tact and smell are strange .
even the architects and civil engineers more to the day are shaking their heads when they hear about this unknown material .
&quot; we wanted to work with recycled materials , &quot; explains Jo@@ op Trojan st , head of the project in the city of S@@ j@@ ken@@ Kenyans .
and that is how one day , in the agricultural exploitation of South Africa , we come up against the right by @-@ product from agriculture .
for many years now , a plastic tissue has been used in the Netherlands and in the Netherlands as a basis for holding the roots of the crop .
this is cheap and efficient material .
this complex tissue lasts two stations and it is then thrown out .
for the library this tissue has been rolling , for the first time in such quantities , up to four centimetres of es@@ li@@ or .
with heat and pressure , the so @-@ called agricultural plastic ( K@@ L@@ P ) changes colour and becomes dark , homogenous , and resilient material that smacks of a new , sports @-@ free car mix .
after 105 , the mountains are at the top of the mountain .
at the end of this continuing almost 500 @-@ metre route around the mountains , the reward awaits us : from the bar not only has a fantastic picture of the city , but it can also be enjoyed from a great deal of rosy Dutch people , and their bloggers in huge macabre areas .
these create a pleasant environment for the two that keep the right air ventilation for this mountain of literature .
donations for a new soul
&quot; although it may well have to be believed to have been a large area , this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology , &quot; he points out .
the necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy .
despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under an enormous glass pyramid , even in the shortest days the sun is only conspicuous for a few hours at home .
the huge wood densities in the cross @-@ border window to the glass façade serve to give a shadow and absorb the majority of the sun &apos;s rays .
this creates a comfortable internal climate .
the rest is a matter of automatic closures .
St@@ fan Plassnik , the skepticism of the information technology sector , has already dared to put the foot in the new library .
and Lis@@ te Ver@@ ha@@ i@@ g has also been there .
similarly , the Chinese professor of traditional medical medicine C@@ n@@ n@@ ž@@ o has visited the library , describing the &quot; Bo@@ k@@ enberg &quot; as the &quot; late soul &quot; of S@@ j@@ ken@@ n@@ ken@@ ics .
the reason for this was that , at the opening of a couple of weeks ago , all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book of their private collection .
this means that at the moment it is intended to fill a library which does not yet have full records ; it currently has 70 000 .
the concept has been extremely important .
the shelves are full .
&quot; there is nothing worse than an empty library , &quot; says the architect Win@@ as .
&quot; I think that thanks to our initiative , all people now have a certain link with this building .
you all know that your book is part of the library .
although it is only there to inspire .
in this way , the M@@ V@@ R@@ V study has achieved a great deal of success in that discipline , which is known as &quot; the creation of an identity &quot; in the specialised forest .
the city of Sp@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ ken@@ ic has written a piece of the history of literature .
regardless of the young man , it is a pity that he may be .
at last , a starting point for shaping its identity .
Buffett : &quot; Germans must play a more leading role &quot;
Germany has abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine .
according to Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o , an expert in US relations , the United States , this puts Berlin in a rather difficult diplomatic position .
Deutsche W@@ elle : at the beginning of the week , Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status of the United Nations .
at last , however , Berlin abstained .
why ?
Stephen Szent : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
however , due to the special relationship that unites Israel , Germany must be careful .
at the same time , however , I believe that it does not support the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel .
during the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany also abstained when it was to establish a flight ban zone .
this has finally been declared by NATO .
is Germany difficult to take a clear stand when important international issues are at stake ?
yes , it is .
this is due to the fact that they are currently being guided by their foreign policy , moving away from a policy led by the United States , to say the least , and by focusing on a German foreign policy .
and what makes it even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy .
the Germans are therefore at a crossroads .
they are expected to play a more independent role , but they are not used to doing so .
I think that they are still ahead of their role , but they have already initiated the path towards a &apos; normal &apos; foreign policy .
a foreign policy similar to the countries such as France or Great Britain .
what , in fact , is a &apos; normal &apos; foreign policy in Germany ?
it is a policy that , when it comes to national interests , is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners .
I believe that Germany &apos;s foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy , that is to say in exports and in its relations with certain regions , such as Russia , China or the Middle East .
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers , and that is why Germany must protect its interests .
are these economic interests influenced by the position taken on the conflict in the Middle East and on the UN vote ?
on the one hand , Germany has large markets in the Middle East , especially in the Gulf .
for this reason it must be careful and not alienated from the Arab public , or from the Arab elites .
that is important , of course .
but I would not attach so much importance to it because it is not a completely unilateral relationship .
but they play a key role in German considerations .
has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions like the vote on Palestine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the United States , the German position has a huge degree of understanding .
for this reason , I do not think that there has been such a drastic breakdown as in the case of Libya .
perhaps Germany has succeeded in gaining a certain amount of respect .
after all , all this has only been done by demonstrating that it is a country that it takes seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account .
there are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe .
instead , the US has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto .
are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations ?
there have always been such disparities because of US domestic policy .
I believe that the Obama administration is in secret a great understanding of the European position .
but , because of the political situation that is happening here , it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public .
I think that the true disparity in opinions does not actually have the size that is given to it .
if we look at relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu , we see Obama is not very enthusiastic about the policy he develops .
is Germany difficult to reconcile the close relations that it holds with Israel and the US , on the one hand , with the position of its major partners in the EU , on the other ?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans .
it would , of course , be easier for the Germans to have a coherent and homogenous European policy , but that is not the case .
therefore , they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher one , but should be driving things from their own position .
that is precisely what the euro is doing now .
I believe that in future Germany will have a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position .
of course , this is not easy for Germany , simply because of the relationship that it holds with Israel .
this has always been a thorny issue .
but I think the Germans are clear that they should play the role of independent figure .
is Germany itself in the role of an important international player and does Germany really wish to take a leading role ?
or is it perhaps difficult to accept that leadership ?
Germany has not yet become accustomed , it is always somewhat inconvenient , and , for obvious reasons , the country still has difficulty playing a more important role .
if we look at the euro crisis , for example , we see that every time we have a position as a major player , some anti @-@ German sentiments are being neglected .
that is not easy for the Germans .
it is an old problem , and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries .
seen in this way , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US .
it must be open to the different neighbours and opinions , and that is not easy .
the US influence in European politics is diminishing more and more , but the EU does not meet that gap for the time being , who is left ?
Germans will have no choice but to take a more decisive role .
even if you do not like it , if you are unpleasant or if you make them even more unpopular , c est la vi@@ e !

&quot; trademark protection &quot; in China : when P@@ ma and Ar@@ man@@ i are suddenly converted into Chinese brands .
Ar@@ man@@ i is a well @-@ known world mark and Marco R@@ al@@ h E@@ al@@ h , too .
but what is Marco Polo ?
behind this name is an officially written name in China but has nothing to do with original companies .
however , it is protected as long as the real saga does not come up with a demand .
and even then it is not clear that they are going to be right .
&quot; it is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , &quot; says Thomas Patten , the law of law @-@ making Taylor W@@ es@@ ar specialised in protection rights violations in the Far East .
a new case is coming to my attention every week .
per@@ iters simply add a couple of letters in order to be able to register their brands .
in this way , G@@ ci becomes L@@ u @-@ G@@ ci and instead of Pro@@ ada &apos;s T@@ ada @-@ You are registered .
German companies are also legally copied in the same way , as has happened to the manufacturer of P@@ ma sports articles .
Pat@@ t@@ lo@@ ch opens a bottle in which he bears seats in the Beijing brand office .
on September 14 , 2010 , a Chinese company asked to record the Z@@ eg@@ na DF P@@ ma mark , an artificial name that also served as the fashionable house Er@@ men@@ gi@@ do Z@@ eg@@ na .
that the Chinese are world champions of copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known .
in large cities , there are plenty of plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting .
however , the cases of Patent are otherwise , on the basis of their customers , the fight against the fact that the brand office officially gives Chinese companies the right to profit from a name that is already registered elsewhere .
the Chinese call it the &quot; B@@ g M@@ ing PA@@ I &quot; or brand accompanying .
the word comes from the Chinese term &apos; B@@ g D@@ uan &apos; ,
that it refers to women who have &quot; fish &quot; to a rich man .
the Chinese authorities are not guilty .
&quot; it is harmful to business , we must fight against it , &quot; demands Pat@@ t@@ ich .
&quot; the brand does water , the monopoly position disappears , and the damage to the image is enormous . &quot;
the financial losses and procedural coasts of the sectors concerned are millions , especially in the case of luxury @-@ based products .
according to data from the C@@ SA market analysis company , with a volume of EUR 15 billion a year , China is in size , the third market for luxury goods and the growing pace .
however , ensuring dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and is also a great deal of money .
the processes can be extended to nine years , and the outcome is uncertain .
Patten speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a demand because it had been so long that the name subject of demand had already become a &quot; market reality . &quot;
&quot; if the complainant is bad , perhaps even he will pay money for the pilgrimage because the process has damaged China &apos;s brand , &quot; he points out .
sometimes this is the law of the jungle .
some of the more well @-@ known cases have to do with graphic elements .
in 2009 , Da@@ im@@ ler @-@ Ben@@ z lost a case against the S@@ PR manufacturer , the company that has been absorbed recently by the German concrete bombs manufacturer &apos;s Putin @-@ Putin .
that is why the Chinese can continue to use a brand like the star of Mercedes .
the buyer of Volvo , Ge@@ el@@ y , at the beginning used a blue @-@ and @-@ blue logo that recalled BMW to a large extent ; the matter is dealt with in the courts and Ge@@ el@@ y , and had to be amended .
the H@@ cost clothing manufacturer lost in China against cash @-@ driven im@@ ac@@ ants from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile eye looking in the opposite direction to the original .
the Chinese authorities are not guilty .
the Beijing marking office in Beijing recognises that in 2010 there have been difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing levels .
last year , however , &quot; the job of emergency labor returned to normal . &quot;
in this way , the number of complaints processes without processing has been reduced by 22 % .
almost 5@@ 7,000 of these cases were resolved , 75 % more than the previous year .
however , 8@@ 500 complaints are still pending in the resolution .
combating this costs a lot of money
as usual in China , the numbers are surprising .
last year the CTBT recorded more than 1.4 million brands of trademark protection , almost one @-@ third than in 2010 .
it would be a new record and means that China is leading the tenth year running the list of new markings all over the world , according to the brand office .
it seems that this is also the case with the number of valid scientists , amounting to 5.5 million in total .
EUR 1.8 billion in rights would have been filled in 2011 .
in other words , this means that , on average , each registration costs EUR 1.@@ 280 ¥ 160 or EUR 160 .
combating this costs a great deal of money , as the case of the German family company Fre@@ ud@@ enberg shows .
for more than seven years the battle group in the courts against a Chinese follow @-@ up .
although the Germans have managed to halt the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts ,
the follow @-@ up has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Fre@@ ud@@ enberg mark .
&quot; we ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany , the names are not protected , &quot; says Han@@ not W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler , President and the Commissioner who is a delegation from Fre@@ ud@@ enberg Ch@@ emi@@ ical Str@@ x@@ ali@@ ties in Munich .
the D@@ O brand office also dismissed the resources of the municipalities .
Fre@@ ud@@ enberg has been right in the next two bodies , but the opposite is still fighting today .
we need a great deal of care .
now the case has come to the doors of the High Court of Justice , where it is still unresolved .
W@@ z@@ z@@ ler is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts .
however , it also states that &apos; the procedure is extremely costly , both in terms of both money and time &apos; .
it is difficult to estimate the internal costs ; the business file has had to review dossiers of up to a hundred years of age in order to be able to provide evidence .
five years ago , Fre@@ ud@@ enberg offered the opposite &quot; sum of six figures in euros &quot; with the aim of reaching a friendly settlement , but it was unsuccessful .
&apos;@@ This shows how much we care about , &quot; says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
the dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe ,
in particular , if the trainees are guaranteed the rights of non @-@ protected brands there .
thus , a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Fre@@ ud@@ enberg for shoes and skin products .
the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has long been able to prevent registration .
&quot; we have to be very careful , &quot; he says W@@ ent@@ ler .
both he and the lawyer @-@ lawyer recommend that German companies be extremely careful when it comes to doing business with China .
it is not enough to have confidence in international legislation on trademark rights , but what we need to do is to &quot; record everything that may be susceptible to protection , &quot; as W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler points out .
otherwise , the issue may be far more expensive than simply registration .
indeed , in the event of Fre@@ ud@@ enberg losing the last assault on his particular battle , he would then have to pay the opposite licence rights on his own behalf , as explained by W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
that or in the section in question would expel us from the market .
world day in the fight against AIDS : dance , help .
in L@@ el@@ el@@ berg , , with the AIDS brother , we are celebrating AIDS orphans .
the story of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8.5 7@@ 33 kilometres of distance .
first of all , you start with the dance : a co@@ w@@ boy b@@ w@@ y , a bal@@ on@@ ade shoe , the shoes of qu@@ on@@ ion and mo@@ o@@ c@@ ines , are looking for the game on the soil of par@@ et , and they find it quickly .
one , two , three , four .
only then do the voices of the shouting , low , low , low , under the carpet , hampered and continue to grow slowly , slowly , slowly .
and the 29 @-@ year @-@ old he is threatening to get off his box by trying to make order with his bold and soft gestures .
it is Monday evening , and in the music room at the Institute of Pennsylvania Medical chorus , a new song is raging .
there have also been the 1950s , between 23 and 69 , from the human gene to the master of the home .
&apos;@@ O@@ m &apos;@@ O@@ ani is not an easy piece , each voice of the chorus has a different text and also in a foreign language that is barely known : the z@@ ul@@ o , a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland .
help for self @-@ help
according to an estimate of UN@@ AIDS , the United Nations programme for the fight against AIDS , around the world , there are roughly 34 million people infected with the HIV virus .
2@@ 3.5 million are living in southern Africa .
there are 2@@ 45 , 000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland .
more than 40 % of the population is already HIV @-@ on .
the Voice of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has found in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of E@@ si@@ ut@@ i .
seventy of them attend secondary school .
for 15 or 20 euros a month , a child can be offered to a child .
this contribution will cover school registration , the uniform and will guarantee a hot food a day in the Go@@ go Center .
Im@@ bon@@ i means in z@@ ul@@ o &quot; narrative of stories &quot; or &quot; pan @-@ regional &quot; .
nobody in this Chamber is aware of the fluid language language , but they do know .
for ten years now , this chorus of songs in this mild foreign language sometimes manages to transport them to the place of origin : southern Africa .
in the north @-@ east of the north @-@ east of the Kingdom of Swaziland , there is a people called E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ i &apos;s , in the north @-@ east of Hong Kong , a people known as the voices of this German chorus .
40 % is infected
approximately 2 000 people are living there , some of them still in simple jokes of mud and straw , a large proportion of them are children .
more than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS .
E@@ si@@ ut@@ i is a small example of what is affecting Swaziland : the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy around the world , according to UNICEF .
the population is not happy with circumcision , a practice that has been demonstrated by half the risk of contagion .
more than 40 % of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the deficiency @-@ deficiency virus , and to die with something more than 30 years has become commonplace .
during a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 , the chorus found this great population , but what they saw above all were many children on the streets that lacked not only the protection of their parents , but of the main : food , clothing , and training .
without instruction , the potential in a poor country is more than limited .
initially , it was only the special commitment of a few which made it possible for a child to be at school and enjoyed a hot food a day - all of that for a few euros .
however , a year later the chorus founded the &quot; D@@ w for Africa &quot; partnership that has since been professionally occupied with AIDS orphans in E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ i .
facts on sexual transmission infections
what are the main diseases of sexual transmission ?
among the bacterial origin @-@ origin ETS , there is the s@@ ag@@ v@@ is , al@@ id@@ ia , and the spotlight .
the most commonly used ETS is AIDS , the human pap@@ li@@ oma virus , genital her@@ di@@ ses , or hepatitis .
hooligans and Sar@@ na find themselves among the derivatives @-@ borne ETS .
what are the main groups to be affected ?
sp@@ y@@ is and the spotlight are more often given to men who maintain sexual relations with other men .
the Robert Koch based on the basis that at least four out of every five cases in Germany have their origin in sex contact between men .
in the case of heterosexual adults , the most common sexually transmitted diseases are infections by al@@ id@@ ia , tri@@ com@@ as , the human so@@ pi@@ oma virus , the candidate ( honor ) and the spotlight .
the spread of HIV among the country &apos;s heterosexual adults is relatively low ; however , roughly 20 % of new HIV infections are recorded in this group .
among young people , infections by al@@ id@@ ia are much more usual than in other population groups .
according to European surveys , three @-@ quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25 .
in our country , the human meal virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people .
how did the number of infections evolve ?
not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to compulsory declaration .
according to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of infections by the number of km has doubled its figure from 1 6@@ 98 cases in 2001 to 3 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
the number of new HIV infections has a downward trend since 2007 .
in 2011 , approximately 2 700 cases were recorded .
that is a tenth , less than in the previous year .
what symptoms do you suggest that this is a mad disease ?
infectious diseases can lead to per@@ gs in the genital area , inconvenience , flow , pain , pain , as well as am@@ m@@ les or gas .
they often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms , and that is why they are not detected .
how can we protect it ?
condoms may reduce the risk of contagion , but they do not provide one hundred per cent protection .
some pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through pathogenic infections and physical contact .
for this reason , experts recommend regular medical examinations , especially if it is often changed by sexual partners .
if they are diagnosed at an early stage , most of the ETS can be cured , and it is possible to avoid any belated consequences .
by means of partnerships , donations and , last but not least , the fees charged by the chorus for their actions across Germany , they are getting enough money .
&quot; in total we have already sent some EUR 200 000 to E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ i , &quot; he is proud to have An@@ te Len@@ z@@ ar@@ z , the chair of the partnership .
in the El Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ am@@ ini , a self @-@ confident woman and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany .
it is about orphans finding good accommodation , for example with one of the hats .
&quot; g@@ alists , &quot; as older women are called , are the pillars of the people .
some of them have up to 14 orphans in office , offering them a roof in their lives and they take care that children come to school every day in time and in their uniforms .
those who do not have a presence left under the protection of Pol i@@ si@@ si@@ le , a single woman who , like the two cook who works every day for more than 200 hungry children , is perceived to be at a wage in the partnership .
moreover , &quot; S@@ w of Africa &quot; has put in place an expensive school , built two chickens , and , in collaboration with American health organization , it has managed to get many of the people of the people to have been subjected to HIV tests .
that is not a matter of course , since , despite the fact that this disease is in the whole country , it is not often spoken openly about it .
a King with 14 wives
&quot; AIDS is an absolute taboo , &quot; he says An@@ ette Len@@ n@@ th@@ z , &quot; because he has to do with sexuality . &quot;
something strange in a country in which the King officially has 14 wives .
the last absolute monarch of the Black Africa , King M@@ ade III , is well known for his wealthy lifestyle and full of excesses .
polygamy instead of democracy .
this form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the very rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades .
but it is also due to the countless seasonal people who travel around the country from one side to the next and which take it where they go .
according to An@@ ette Len@@ z@@ ar@@ z , &apos; in any corner you can get free condoms , but these are hardly used .
it is another culture , here only they accept skin contact against fur . &quot;
to encourage cultural exchange , the chorus travels every two or three years for southern Africa by shouting that talk about gloom , fighting , hope , and trust in the black race , songs that many at the most southern end of the African continent still remember the era of apartheid .
a bus that is full of whites who shout in a black language , so much recognition , does not only bring an excellent atmosphere and a great deal of joy , but has also managed to get a couple of tears away from some of the tears of a new border soldier .
the journey always leads to E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ i , where the viewers visit the child @-@ loving children .
despite the fact that this small population hardly appears on the maps , in the River E@@ z@@ ul@@ wi@@ i valley , it is well known .
&apos;@@ Action to E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ i , there is light there &apos; , says the people of the place .
and after travelling on the 8@@ 7@@ 33 kilometers of a straight back to the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of Berlin , one realises that it is also possible to see a great light from there .
Mat@@ en@@ ger : NASA discovered ice in Mer@@ cured Mer@@ om
the M@@ en@@ s@@ ger has found evidence of ice in Mer@@ cured .
the ice layer is likely to have a sea of up to 20 metres .
NASA , the American space agency , has provided evidence of ice in Mer@@ cured .
despite the fact that the planet is close to the sun , there is also ice ice there , as emerges from three studies published on Thursday in the specialised magazine &quot; Science . &quot;
the M@@ sen@@ ger wave would have found evidence that in the world area that is permanently in the shadow , a ice layer has been set up .
it seems that it has at least 30 centimetres and probably even 20 metres .
the water is presumably committed or , most likely , an asteroid that , in its day , ran aground against Mer@@ cured .
no one links the ice @-@ finding with the possibility that there is life on the planet , it claims the researcher chief of the M@@ á@@ s@@ anger , Se@@ an Solzhenitsyn .
the temperature in Mer@@ cure may reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees .
however , the findings could help to clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system .
completely unnoticed for the planet &apos;s Earth , the sounds , tel@@ uc@@ es , and small robots like the P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x to explore the depths of the universe .
from time to time they send images to the Earth : small windows to the immeasurable area of space .
the picture comes from a chamber developed by German researchers from the Max Pla@@ ak Institute .

this section of an in @-@ depth image taken by the tel@@ eli@@ o S@@ t@@ zer shows a &quot; family picture &quot; where there are endless generations of stars : the oldest stars are shown as blue spots , though the most difficult to recognize is the rose color of the &quot; newborn &quot; stars .
this region of star @-@ training , which is a little romantic in scientists W@@ 5 , was discovered by the tel@@ eli@@ o S@@ t@@ zer in the constellation of C@@ asi@@ op@@ a , to a distance of 6 500 years in light .
this vicious image of a extinction star was taken by NASA &apos;s tel@@ eli@@ o Sp@@ t@@ zer .

there are new stars coming from gas and dust from gas and dust from gas and dust in the enormous fog at the 5 400 years of the Earth .

the combination of a normal photograph and an image of under @-@ eyes gives rise to a spectacular colour .
this looming star could be captured in the whole of his glory for the first time by the under @-@ viewers of the tel@@ eli@@ o S@@ t@@ zer .
in the name of the big problem of astronomical Abenomics , it is still one of the great uncertainties .
it is probably about the remnants of one of the S@@ es@@ no that disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago .
one of the biggest and most distinct photographs taken by the Hu@@ d@@ o @-@ box , the T@@ af@@ ia in Edinburgh .
depending on nonsense , some images of greyhounds will become real works of art .
the image published by the European Observatory &apos;s Southern Monitoring Centre shows the unclear nature of a number of thousands of years of light in the S@@ ag@@ ical constellation .
the name so far comes from the &quot; tri@@ g@@ us &quot; term ( divided in three ) , as dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this sub @-@ prime training area into three .
in the constellation of O@@ af@@ u@@ o the asy@@ om@@ ists , you were able to lecture the signs of a self @-@ tuning : to 400 million years of Earth , the centres of two greyhounds in the merger process should go to the other in order to end up in an irreversible way .
this star @-@ formation was captured by the Hu@@ b@@ o @-@ like TV directory in the downward spiral of M@@ 83 .
those who do not like technical short @-@ term may refer to it with the high @-@ profile heart of the southern hemisphere .
the photograph of the Hu@@ il@@ ical space of space shows a section of the dark I@@ is in the C@@ us@@ dy constellation .
the vague light of 1.4 years is composed of dust particles whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house .
this image was created from optical images and radi@@ ations made by different tel@@ ches .
it shows a ring of black holes in the world &apos;s 4@@ 30 million light years .
this group of greyhounds , called Ar@@ p 2@@ 73 , served for a moment of model for NASA &apos;s D@@ um@@ ical space @-@ run space .
scientists call the larger spiral of larger size U@@ G@@ C 18@@ 10 .
the most brilliant young star @-@ star stars of our Via L@@ ach@@ es is found to be found in this fog .
this high @-@ training area is constantly producing new stars .
in this cloud of stars , associated with the dark Ro@@ se@@ ta , it also is continually emerging new star - to 5 000 years of Earth &apos;s light .
there is still no dust in this brilliant black hole with a small black hole , only gas .
the researchers assume that it was in fact formed after the big bang , when in the universe it could be found mainly on hydrogen .
our window to the universe : the most important tel@@ ets
it would appear that the TV directory was invented by Hans Lipponen and 16@@ 08 before Galileo An@@ le@@ i used it a year later to see the stars .
since that time , the mirrors of the self @-@ treatment has not stopped growing , and the images that they offer us have more and more depth .
for 30 years , specifically from 1947 to 1975 , the Hal@@ o B@@ e located at the Monitoring Centre near San Di@@ go was the largest in the world .
his mirror , in the image , had a five @-@ metre underground .
in Arizona , the United States is closed down by the French Government .
it makes it possible to see the trend through two mirrors , each with an 8.4 metre metre .
the interior of the Canaries located on the island of La Pal@@ ma is enormous - only the mirror has a 10.@@ 4 metres .
the mirror of the Sou@@ t@@ land Al@@ ri@@ an L@@ ge T@@ op@@ pe in South Africa is taken up in order to save costs .
in spite of this , it reaches a clear underground of approximately 11 metres .
the downside of this more economic construction is that the TV shelf has a fixed raising point , so that its mobility is limited .
a fixed raising angle also has a fixed increase in the TV directory @-@ E@@ ber@@ a .
its specificity is its enormous capacity to collect light .
despite a comparatively smaller mirror metre , such a capacity is comparable to that of the world &apos;s largest mirror @-@ like .
researchers can explore the universe in search of extra @-@ land signs .
there is a limit of 3@@ 05 metres in the field of radio .

this is the question of the Ver@@ ge T@@ ge T@@ eli@@ a , a tel@@ ist who is honoured by his name .
with a total of four mirrors , this self @-@ choice can also upset the middle @-@ out spectrum .
the ES@@ O will also host the so @-@ called E @-@ EL@@ T ( European Tr@@ el@@ el@@ e Lar@@ ge T@@ op@@ pe or the extremely Great European T@@ eli@@ o &apos; .
its primary mirror will cover 42 metres , and it will be made up of a total of 1,000 spotlight elements .
until 2018 , we are not expected to be able to take images .
up to 2007 , the two TV viewers , in the case of Ma@@ un K@@ NA , were regarded as the largest in the world .
they have two mirrors , each with a 10 @-@ metre underground .
the M@@ ann@@ os K@@ check is in the Monitoring Centre Ma@@ an K@@ EA , which , together with them , explored the sky with the help of the Su@@ bar@@ o Su@@ bar@@ o and the IR@@ T@@ T@@ F .
in Ma@@ a K@@ EA , a new , huge @-@ scale tel@@ der is to be built , with a mirror underground of 30 metres .
that is a picture of how it would be .
however , the most important information in the maze comes from the hand of the Hu@@ il@@ room space of space .
since 24 April 1990 , it sends images of distant worlds .
since March 2009 , the TV tel@@ liner is looking for semi @-@ solar planets , mainly those that are accustomed .
on 2 February 2011 , NASA announced that from the start of its mission , 1.@@ 235 candidates had been located in planets .
in the picture , the final preparatory preparations for the launch of the K@@ ot@@ er space of the K@@ ow@@ er should be made available .
the TV TV system ( J@@ W@@ T ) is not going to be launched on the space on board of a Ariane rocket to 2018 up to 2018 .
the primary mirror of this platform for space is a 6.5 @-@ metre underground .
one of the functions of this TV card will be to look for the first stars and greyhounds composed behind the big bang .
the researchers assume that in the south of Mer@@ cured , there is also ice .
but there is no strong evidence , since the M@@ he@@ o@@ anger revolves around the planet in a far closer orbit to the north .
for decades , radar measurements point to the ice in Mer@@ cured .
thanks to the M@@ en@@ s@@ anger wave ( 2004 ) , the first to orbit around Mer@@ cured , scientists now have the certainty that this is the case .

the journey in the mountainous region of Tal@@ y@@ h could be described as savage and romantic .
the mini @-@ bus is progressing with a great deal , through the pi@@ ly road that passes through the hills , large rivers , and the simple houses of local farmers .
it is all green and great , one might even think that it is in the Black Forest .
however , we are in the southern area of Azerbaijan ; from here on the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away .
here is a &apos; tal@@ y@@ hi &apos; people , a people of which there is not much knowledge , apart from the fact that they well dominate the Persian and the Azeri , who are very long @-@ standing .
our final destination is L@@ ren@@ k .
this small city boasts a perhaps too mild architecture designed in the Soviet era , and which does not seem to fit the whole into such a bizarre mountain landscape .
European tourists do not reach this place just now , because the path from the capital of Azerbaijan , Bakiyev , is too heavy .
we need eight hours for the 3@@ 23 kilometres that divide both towns and cities , because the road is one of the same .
the amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this very strong region .
but , 48 , 48 ) is convinced that L@@ ren@@ k has what needs to be done to become a tourist attraction .
&quot; Bakiyev was known in May for the celebration of the Euro@@ vision Day , and next year we will celebrate the oldest people in the world , &quot; he points to Ham@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
it is the leader of the longevity Museum , perhaps the only one that exists in the world .
it has been documented in this House of eight dozen out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ age mountains of the place that have been over 100 years old .
this is my grandfather , who lived for 120 years .
a Children &apos;s son died at the age of 136
the undisputed star of the museum , however , is the sheep of sheep , in the case of sheep , who seems to have lived in 168 years .
however , there is no starting point for it to be certified .
and if we bear in mind that the most well @-@ documented man has lived in 122 , the age of Ha@@ l@@ ü@@ ov seems to be rather suspicious .
&quot; he was born in the region in 18@@ 05 and died in 1973 , &quot; he explained to us .
the man was married three times and he had 23 children .
have it been wrong then to speculate to the age of a couple of decades in the past ?
however , R@@ th@@ an@@ t Sch@@ ol@@ z , the S@@ on@@ t@@ th@@ logue at the Max Pla@@ g@@ k Institute in Ro@@ stock , has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia .
&quot; in some regions of China , Japan , or the Hungarian valley in Pakistan , too , they are living at a very advanced age , &quot; claims Sch@@ ol@@ z , &quot; even in Sardinia , there are many larger men . &quot;
due to a lack of documentation it is impossible to provide scientific evidence on the age , especially when there is no civil register either .
all of the days in which butter is full of butter
it is a fact that , surprisingly often , people in the region around L@@ ag@@ k usually reach a biblical age .
there are currently 20 people over 100 years of age .
why do so many elderly people live here in the south ?
the Azerbaijani tourist guide Far@@ d Mu@@ im@@ z@@ ad@@ eh explains that it is about the special genes of the sh@@ is@@ ans .
the director of the museum , Mrs Sam ul@@ ay@@ eva , believes in contrast that the cause lies in food .
however , from a nutritional point of view , it does not seem logical that it is precisely the rich low @-@ stock @-@ rich nutrition that loves meat , bread and , above all , the dairy products and many of which , moreover , drink a daily glass of wild butter on a daily basis .
or perhaps it is the natural life of life that keeps young people - in C@@ en@@ em@@ an , a small settlement , not far from the city of L@@ ag@@ k , Ru@@ b@@ y@@ vi@@ ay@@ eva .
it is relatively young for 97 years for what is supposed to be for these Latin Americans .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 143 descendants , lives in a simple wood home typical of the entire Caucasus region .
sitting on the ground , it is relentlessly driving a huge glass of butter .
eight people are living under a roof , including one of the children and the daughter of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , both of which became grandparents a long time ago .
they also take two small children out of one side .
in the kitchen , they prepared tea for guests , a tea serving in typical , typical vessels .
the teeth of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva are white , and perfectly aligned , and under the headscarf , he is hiding two dark ru@@ bles of dark hair that his son finds himself to be proud of .
I have always taken a ride with milk , which is why I have never fallen and has maintained its colour .
&quot; I have not ever used a statue , &quot; says Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
pensions is enough to live
it has always eaten only what it produced on its own farm : tomatoes , potatoes and butchers .
in all my life I have never been buying a supermarket .
then we talk about your husband , who was in the army .
the worst was the post @-@ World War II era .
yet everything went on to his feet when the &quot; beloved father , &quot; He@@ y@@ da Aliyev , took control of the situation .
this kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouths of a larger woman .
in Azerbaijan , however , the cult that is attached to the paternalistic figure of the nation , which is directed at its country as a dictator , knows no limits .
he remained in power until 2003 , when he gave the witness to his son Il@@ ham .
at least the elderly people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva is taking up 230 man@@ at ( approximately the same amount in euros ) in the concept of a monthly pension , an amount with which to live well in view of the situation here .
and perhaps the son of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva is right : &apos; in our culture the greatest is very respected &apos; .
they live in a large family , they are loved , they are all the necessary care and they are happy .
as if this were not good enough reason to be alive for many years ...
the Constitution is missing the expression &apos; Human Rights &apos;
the revolution has returned to Cairo .
demonstrations which rival each other in Cairo demonstrate the tremendous divide in which the country is in the process .
the future constitution , with Sharia law , is very controversial .
the Egyptian President did not make up on patenting .
&quot; we must overcome the transition .
and that that happens is my responsibility , to the people and to God , &quot; he said on public television .
his speech was directed at the whole of the people , especially the Christian Copts , the liberals , enlightened Muslims and secular Muslims .
all of them , who have so far been helpless in a confused opposition , are afraid .
fear of a theocracy on the shores of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community .
as Mohammed Mur@@ si explains , almost to apologise , he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his powers to save the revolution . &quot;
neither the Egyptians nor the world , however , are well aware of what this 61 @-@ year engineer with a PhD given by the University of South California really wants to save .
does it intend to deprive the judiciary of its power ?
in fact , the 2@@ 34 articles , whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamists at a night meeting of 15 hours , are truly worrying .
as in previous constitutions , the draft also states that the case @-@ law is based on the &apos; principles of Islamic law &apos; .
but what does that mean from &quot; principles ? &quot;
this was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists are going to exploit this vague formulation , as well as the legal room for manoeuvre that is taking place , to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia law .
this is at least what a new article suggests : on all Sharia issues , it is compulsory to consult al @-@ Ash@@ ar University , the country &apos;s most important Islamic institution with great power in all Sunni Islamism .
it does not have to be the case , but this can mean that the clergy would monitor legislation , something that , in fact , would result in the in@@ empowerment of the judiciary .
a large part of the constitution &apos;s draft is open to interpretation
what is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction .
during the Mubarak dictatorship , these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition .
after the dictator , up to 11 000 civilians were arrested in military prisons .
as set out in the draft , the state must protect &quot; the real essence of the Egyptian family &quot; and &quot; promote its morals and values . &quot;
it is such a vague formulation in legal terms that , with the help of this article , state institutions could even control the content of film and literature .
clearly , this is nothing other than censorship .
indeed , no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women .
on the other hand , it prohibits offending the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies .
however , it is not clear what an offence is , and how to be punished .
equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits the &quot; offending people . &quot;
is a caricature of the president enough , or a joke about a sign ?
a question of interpretation , like so many other things in the draft that it has been presented to Mur@@ if for its signature and which , according to the words , &apos; very soon &apos; will be presented to the Egyptians to be put to a referendum .
&quot; revolution has returned . &quot;
a few weeks ago the opposition is closing ranks in the face of the superiority of the Islamists .
ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony in Friday evening in the Tahrir Square of the C@@ ary and declared to fail the Minutes before they can enter into force .
&quot; the revolution has returned , and we will end up won , &quot; says Ham@@ din Saberi , who is in the third place on the presidential election lists .
the Nobel Peace Prize and former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed El @-@ Baradei , declared that the draft constitution should be &quot; in the dustbin of history . &quot;
through Twitter , he accused the followers of Murmansk if he wanted to lead a &quot; state coup against democracy . &quot;
&quot; when he calls the referendum to his palace , and we will overthrow him , &quot; he claims the opposition to Sa@@ id .
&quot; we are not yet tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been overseen , &quot; the Egyptian media political opposition was cited in the Egyptian media .
and several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum , so they would not be regarded as valid .
&quot; the Koran is our constitution . &quot;
for its part , the well @-@ organised Muslim community called for a counter @-@ station , if not in Tahrir Square , but after a sentence on the other side of the Nile , at the University of Cairo .
many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salaf@@ ists took part in the cry of : &quot; the people require the application of divine law . &quot;
they called on Mur@@ a &quot; clean up the country &quot; while proclaiming : &quot; the Koran is our constitution . &quot;
a struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic square in Tahrir , where everything began , would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war .
it is clear that the supporters of Murmansk did not want to risk this happening .
the Muslim brothers claimed that both opponents of the constitution &apos;s draft and the supporters of the constitution would have expressed their views loud and clear .
the time would now have come to let the people decide what direction the country should follow .
in this respect , the majority of the Islamists seems to have been guaranteed by the draft .
&apos;@@ the expression &apos; Human Rights &apos; does not even appear &apos;
H@@ af@@ z Abu Sa@@ ak is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all the social forces .
this 48 @-@ year lawyer specialised in human rights and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization ( E@@ O@@ R ) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak &apos;s dictatorship .
not because he shared his ideology , but because for him human rights are indivisible .
for this reason it was beaten , condemned and imprisoned .
&quot; and now the expression &quot; Human Rights &quot; does not even appear in the new constitution , &quot; he regrets in a conversation with the newspaper &quot; W@@ t am Lu@@ n@@ t@@ ag . &quot;
the extension of the powers of Mur@@ if the three powers of the State made this lawyer resigned .
the measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship .
&quot; instead of strengthening civil society , what the president has done is to abolish it , &quot; he regrets .
however , democracy cannot function without civil society organisations .
he feels abandoned , also by the international community , which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the shores of the Nice with a mixture of curiosity and tension .
this could be done against it .
a state in Tahrir Square warns : &quot; you are seeing a monster that you do not control . &quot;
Norwegian ak@@ as@@ sk : is the poorest fish in the world ?
the five million people of Norway have one of the highest standards of living , not only in Europe but in the world .
is it possible for the success of the country to have any relationship with its greed for extremely bad fish ?
take a number of excessively curable ones .
laugh in the middle of a dirty and wet mountain of football clothes .
please give it a week .
then we will be able to have the crippling the crippling , one of Norway &apos;s high @-@ tech people .
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ n@@ o , about three hours in Oslo .
the landscape is spectacular and this smell , always present , is a fleet in the air .
there is a great deal of fuss about the fact that water is being kept in water for , depending on how badly you prefer it , up to one year .
as it obscures and is becoming more cold , the Norwegians come into a festival that takes place here , in F@@ ag@@ n@@ o , devoted to this man@@ ling of the most , so to speak , to the tune .
&quot; oil is eaten and then a glass of a traitor , &quot; says H@@ av@@ ard Hal@@ y@@ sen , a city &apos;s scandal that is also what is known as the &quot; R@@ ak@@ af@@ sk General , &quot; which is responsible for organising the festival .
on all sides , we see people eating this fish that is kept in small shops and drinking to a major amount of drink .
&quot; some people like it more , it says H@@ av@@ ard . &quot;
drink can kill the smell .
let us choose some pieces .
if you can avoid going close to the nose , it is not wrong ; it is not quite different from a portion of suspicious a few kilometres in bus .
it is a product that comes from a very different era , in which the poverty hit Norway and in which , before the cooling of cooling , fish were kept in the dark autumn in water and salt in closed barrels .
later , in the middle of winter , when it is already well @-@ built , it is taken away and , obviously , on the ground on the ground due to alcohol , it is eaten .
just a generation ago , thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work , and they emigrated mainly to the United States .
today , the population is rising rapidly ; more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by plenty of jobs , high wages , and a complete social services system .
a population of Sweden &apos;s old rival , even far more rich than Norway , reaches this country to work .
the ak@@ fi@@ sk is considered important , an essential part of Norway &apos;s past , an essential part of the past .
it is among the most expensive plates that can be bought .
but , in fact , it is expensive : a beer @-@ cane or a P@@ ann@@ os cost the cold of 10 € 14 ( $ 14 ) .
Norway does not often appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it .
here , people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Bethell , the far @-@ right racist of the extreme right , who killed and murdered 77 people , including men , women and children .
instead , they refer to the shooting as &quot; the event of 22 July . &quot;
it is hard for the Norwegians to believe that their home country would be able to commit such cruelty and murder .
after much of Norway &apos;s current wealth is growth , from the early 1970 &apos;s , from one of the world &apos;s largest oil and gas industries .
&quot; but oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well , &quot; says Anna , our shrimp , as long as it is going to slip away from ak@@ fi@@ sk , and that , with its long bl@@ is@@ ous fog and its surprising blue eyes , it represents the image of Norwegian welfare .
&quot; we are , as you will be prudent people . &quot;
his English , like that of the majority of people in this country , is impeccable .

Mexico : Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
as Mexico &apos;s incoming President , Enrique Peña Nieto , is preparing to take office , the BBC correspondent W@@ ill @-@ ant examines the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population .
traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad today .
in a city which , under the best circumstances , is already under way , has since Monday been a steel siege which has fallen short by several of the main roads that lead to the city and which is causing huge chaos on the roads .
the aim , however , was not to prevent workers from being able to come to their workplace , but to prevent the demonstrators from coming to parliament .
on Saturday , Mexico &apos;s new president , Enrique Peña Nieto , will receive the presidential band and take the management of the nation .
he faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been making good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón , but the country finds itself in a war against the narcotic drugs that has already claimed 60 000 lives in six years .
&quot; my government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence , &quot; explained by Mr Peña Nieto earlier this week to US President Barack Obama in the O@@ val Office .
&quot; I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal . &quot;
before taking up the US president , the previous political experience of Mr Peña Nieto was as a governor of his native state , that of Mexico .
a highly populated and rapidly growing state around the capital ; opinions about the new leader are divided into the territory in which he used to move .
a candid Man
in the city of Br@@ o Valley , for example , it is remembered with affection .
its residents attribute the credit for the growth of tourism in the place and infrastructure construction .
to get to the city , he can be driven by one of Peña Nieto &apos;s new roads , which is a huge improvement compared to far @-@ reaching , bumpy @-@ rich roads .
they can also see plates on their behalf in the entry of an impressive interactive museum on climate change .
&quot; we hope that he will manage to make a real and lasting change , &quot; he says his friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ e@@ Hernández , a Member of Mr Peña Nieto &apos;s party , the PRI .
&quot; particularly in security and economics , we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs . &quot;
after a uninterrupted period of 81 years in power , the PRI was dismissed by Vicente Fox in the year 2000 .
a Member of the Member of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats admits that , after 12 years outside of the presidential palace in the United Kingdom &apos;s presidential palace , there are many expectations on the part of Enrique Peña Nieto .
it also rejects the rating that the opposition makes from the essence of the new president .
&quot; he is a very sincere , very committed man with an excellent vision of the country .
he is a fantastic man of state and , above all , he is a person who knows to listen . &quot;
on the other side of the state , however , that is not the impression that many people have on their former governor .
in Nestlé , known as N@@ za City as well , the contrast with the well @-@ known streets of the Br@@ o Valley could not be higher .
hidden under high motorway sections is , in many ways , a sub@@ pressing for Mexico &apos;s own City .
and the community &apos;s problems are also tough and urban .
at the beginning of this year the military intervention was called for to help the fight against the drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious .
in a desert area , located along with a rubbish dump , the bodies of dozens of women who have been killed have been left over the past two years .
more than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Peña Nieto was the governor , a much higher rate than that of the Roma City , sadly known for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women .
the critics of Mr Peña Nieto say , at best , that he failed to address the problem of feminicide while he was in office .
the most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye .
in a concrete house , typical of the damaged neighborhood , Ir@@ in@@ a Bu@@ aj@@ a has to make efforts to contain tears while showing photographs of his deceased daughter , Mari@@ ana moon .
according to the official version of the facts , Mar@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 .
his family , however , believes that his couple murdered him .
&quot; when I arrived at his house , it seemed as if he had cleaned up the body , &quot; Mrs Bu@@ ada recalls .
&quot; there were signs that it had been hit , and rigour had already appeared . &quot;
as long as his mother returns the story , a photograph of Mar@@ ana notes from the walls , along with a cross in which one single word is read : justice .
however , that is exactly what the family says has been denied .
&quot; the state authorities have tried to me as if they were an old flame , a tor@@ dent , a complaining .
what they want is for you to simply accept what they say and that they are on the streets . &quot;
&quot; but that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence , &quot; it says .
the presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years , and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office .
&quot; I hope that it is the same kind of president that he was when he was Governor , &quot; says the member of the PRI Ol@@ g@@ en in Br@@ o Valley .
however , that is precisely what the families of the victims of Mexico most fear .
Franc@@ ley Man@@ ning did not denounce ill @-@ treatment , according to the prosecutors
the prosecutors are trying to cope with allegations of mis@@ law abuse in prison during their stay in prison .
the judgment is on the period of Man@@ ning in the military prison of Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the defense calls for the case to be dismissed on the basis that Man@@ ning &apos;s imprisonment was severe .
the army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents .
the prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that the Franc@@ ley soldier , accused of the largest leak of confidential information in the US history , lost many opportunities to denounce the ill @-@ treatment that he now claims to have suffered as long as military detention was under military arrest .
during the interrogation that the Public Prosecutor &apos;s prosecutor did in the run @-@ up to the trial in F@@ T , Mar@@ y@@ land , the tax commander Ash@@ den F@@ in claimed that the weekly visits of the unit &apos;s office of unity that Man@@ ning received during nine months of detention in Qu@@ anti@@ co , Virginia , show no denunciation of the treatment he received .
the questioning , which was carried out during the wake of the request to defend the case , given that its incarceration had been harsh , and that this had already been punished enough , came a day after Man@@ ning had testified that he had tried to commit suicide as he was arrested .
the army &apos;s intelligence analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq .
later , WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet .
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Man@@ ning was the source of information .
in the light of Friday , F@@ in revised the forms that officials filled after visits to Man@@ ning during his arrest in the Qu@@ anti@@ co military prison , where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011 .
the officers would have asked Man@@ ning and noted his replies .
when Fridays asked the forms on Friday , Man@@ ning acknowledged that he had described the treatment given to pen@@ ors as &quot; excellent &quot; and the treatment of plants in general as &quot; very professional . &quot;
the forms show no denunciation of ill @-@ treatment , despite the fact that officials asked Man@@ ning directly about the treatment he received , claimed F@@ in .
Man@@ ning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues , and that the officers who visited him had talked about these problems and had indicated that they would deal with them , but that they did not put on record those issues in the register .
&quot; they said &quot; no impact &quot; ( having talked about the problems ) , but that does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problem , &quot; he said .
the judge , Cor@@ ad@@ v of the D@@ eni@@ da Army , also asked Man@@ ning for what he had not denounced during the meeting during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a board responsible for examining the intentions of suicide that he had expressed in a months before .
Man@@ ning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the &quot; injury prevention &quot; regime under which he was .
the military said that it had put it under this restrictive regime , which is a degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide , to ensure their protection and security for others .
&quot; I wanted the largest state to know that I was well and ( I wanted ) to stop being under injury ... to enjoy what , in my view , is a better quality of life , &quot; said Man@@ ning .
Man@@ ning testified on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the headquarters in Qu@@ anti@@ co , Virginia , in July 2010 .
he said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost his knowledge due to heat .
he said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening or what happened in the outside world was very distressing .
&quot; my world was reduced only to Dolly the cage , &quot; that cage , &quot; explained Man@@ ning on Thursday .
&quot; I thought I would die in this cage . &quot;
Man@@ ning said that , once he moved to Qu@@ anti@@ co , he spent the majority of the days in a small cell , at least for 21 hours , often for 23 hours , without a company .
Man@@ ning said that he was only allowed to have a cushion , a man@@ ite , a ch@@ ec@@ ro@@ ts , a bit of clothes , and his glasses .
he explained that he was trying to move all the time , because he was banned from sleep or even lying down during the day .
Man@@ ning said that he always had a light from outside , pointing out to his eyes as he was sleeping .
he said that if the butchers could not see the face when they went around the night , they woke up to get back .
Man@@ ning &apos;s lawyer in January 2011 presented a formal complaint about the treatment he received Man@@ ning .
Man@@ ning was transferred to the military prison in Chişinău in Kansas in April 2011 .
on Friday , the judge asked Man@@ ning about a plea that he had made in Thursday &apos;s statement , according to which , after being forced a night night to sleep naked in his Qu@@ anti@@ co cell , he was forced to count on the road to staying a futile problem in front of the butchers and other prisoners .
Man@@ ning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover up with the man@@ ite during the counting .
during the judge of the judge on Friday , Man@@ ning said that he became sure of the order he gave him that he had to leave the man@@ ite that he could have covered , but he acknowledged that he had not ordered him to leave it .
Man@@ ning testified on Thursday who had been forced to sleep naked last night because of an attempt to show an official that he was not a danger to himself .
Man@@ ning said that he had been told to the official that he could have used the elastic of his internal clothes or his ch@@ ec@@ ants , but he had not done so .
Man@@ ning showed that the night had been withdrawn from his cell &apos;s cell in his inner clothes , his cha@@ u@@ als , and his glasses .
his lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences that he spent during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he was condemned at the war council , which is scheduled to start at the beginning of next year .
the defense said that it intends to make Man@@ ning guilty of minor offences and defend other accusations that were regarded as too extreme .
it is expected to resume this weekend and will expect the prosecutors to argue that the conditions of detention were justified .
the Pentagon has maintained that Man@@ ning was held in line with all detainees under maximum custody in Qu@@ anti@@ co .
the charges against Man@@ ning include cooperation with the enemy , illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet , leaked from national defence information , and theft of public property or records .
if he is declared guilty of all charges , he could face life imprisonment .
my Mexican @-@ American identity crisis
it says that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunity .
Mexicans tend to criticize those who were ; they say that they remember Mexicans from difficult times .
Navalny says that Mexico @-@ Americans are trapped between two worlds .
on a recent trip to Mexico City , it had barely gone down by the exterminated and arrived at the immigration processing zone and was already completely confused .
posters indicated the road to two queues : one for &quot; M@@ ex@@ eli@@ ans , &quot; and another for &quot; foreigners . &quot;
I was there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go .
having grown in Central California , for my entire life , I have been called &quot; Mexican . &quot;
it is a matter of ethnic flight , just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &apos; Irish &apos; or my friends in New York are described as &apos; Italians &apos; .
later , I decided on a &quot; Mexican @-@ US . &quot;
but that was Mexico .
and , in my grandfather &apos;s own homeland , the taxi or guide was not necessary .
it was simply an American .
I am speaking Spanish , well enough for me to be able to take an interview in this language .
but I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native , and I cannot shake off my American accent .
so I took my US passport and put me in the foreign queue .
I thought at that time of this week that Mexico &apos;s elected president , Enrique Peña Nieto , visited the White House to meet President Obama .
on the agenda , as always with the leaders of these two countries , it was : immigration , drugs and trade .
Peña Nieto was eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy , one of the reasons why a Mexican Mexican economy is now so likely to remain in Mexico as it would venture to go to the US .
it wants to join the United States and Canada and create a European Union @-@ style commercial bloc in North America .
moreover , Peña Nieto promised to continue the fight against the drug cartels in Mexico , although he did not give details .
for Mexico , the relationship with the US is complicated and full of bitterness .
probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 1848 , Mexico invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to yield half of its territory at the top of a gun .
but for Mexicans , who think in centuries , not in minutes , the elements that are reminiscent of it are everywhere .
so , at a time when an US official says anything that holds the slightest criticism of Mexico , he will have a temptation to hear complaints , both in the press and among the Mexican elite , about how Americans are evading the sovereignty of their neighbors .
and the children of M@@ eni@@ z@@ ma are in the middle of war .
and yet , for Mexico , the relationship that really means a challenge is the one that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican @-@ Americans who live in the United States .
do we talk of bitterness ?
there is a lot .
in Mexico there are winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not .
the only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Los Angeles , the V@@ ak , P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , Denver or San Antonio is that , at some point in our mother tree , there was one person , the father or the mother or one of the grandparents , who was closed off the door door in Mexico and had to go to the north .
and most of the people sometimes fit a certain profile : obscure skin , a low level of studies , from a poor people , etc .
we are their top @-@ down , and we are loyal to them .
Mexico is not .
and despite the fact that we are perhaps now living in the American dream , having gone to good schools and having had good jobs , we must never lose sight of the fact that what we are seeing is this , the American dream , and not the Mexican dream .
sometimes our identity may not be clear , but our loyalty is .
it is for the United States .
moreover , we are aware that many of the Mexicans in the elite of the ruling class do not like them .
the feeling is mutual .
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look beyond the shoulder as if we were from a smaller category that was not Mexican enough .
our Spanish Spanish will never be good enough , and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough .
in their view , our existence is synonymous with failure .
if our families had not failed in Mexico , they would not have been .
and now we would not be trapped in the wake of this Silk Curtain , living well in the United States but , still , as empty souls .
my wife , who was born in Gu@@ champions and wine legally to the United States when he was a girl , reminds me that there is this shell between the Mexicans and the Mexican @-@ Americans , because the first people will know more strongly who they are , and in the second few seconds that does so .
although it is a citizen of the United States , she is regarded as part of the two countries .
meanwhile , many Mexican @-@ Americans who know that they are not part of either .
we love to listen to the Mexican group , the North Tigers , but also Brussels S@@ ing@@ st@@ lin .
you have the best of each country , but you are not rooted in any of them .
we in Mexico see us as Americans .
and in the United States , we are regarded as Mexicans .
now , to complicate matters further , for my trip , some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora .
they want the Mexican @-@ Americans to work as &quot; ambassadors &quot; in Mexico , representing their interests in the US .
we would say to our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would put pressure on the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico .
yes , of course ...
that is not going to happen .
there is too much bitterness .
and , with wage inequality , rampant corruption , and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country .
I am afraid you are going to be left alone with this idea , friends .
it is right .
if some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the US for the way in which they dealt with Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican @-@ Americans are still suffering from how they dealt with their relatives a little less time ago .
1 mm .
perhaps we are more &quot; Mexicans &quot; than I thought .
old battles , the Middle East
the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a unlikely basis for peace .
could there be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ?
another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain .
in the middle of useless and regular discussions about who started first , mountains of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv , the mainland of Israel , and the holy city of Jerusalem .
but , although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict , everything in the Middle East is changing .
the Arab Spring has left everything , whether or not they like it , Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in regional turmoil .
perhaps this will make his fight even more bloody than before .
but there are reasons to think that its lethal impasse could be broken .
a War that is not lost or won
at first glance , optimism seems very difficult to justify today .
even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November , the clashes this week have strengthened the hawks on both sides .
Hamas &apos;s leaders , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw , despite the fact that Gaza has been lucky .
and , despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most miserable and villages of the planet , Israel has not been able to end up with Hamas .
indeed , Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank , the other part of Palestine currently governed by the most moderate Fatah rival , the most moderate Palestinian faction .
moreover , Hamas &apos;s leaders might come to the conclusion that time is playing in their favor .
since the Islamists have been gaining influence across the Arab world , Hamas has made powerful and powerful friends .
Turkey , a resurgent regional power that had previously been the most close Muslim ally to Israel , has embraced Hamas &apos;s cause , as has Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic countries of the Gulf .
the exotic Hamas members say that the Islamist moon is surrounded by Israel , from Lebanon to the north , where the Hezbollah @-@ led militia in Syria dominate , where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad , even to Jordan , where Hamas &apos;s allies are threatening the king .
especially on Israel &apos;s southern flank , the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s growth led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt , unlike the most populous and fundamental countries of Arab countries , has changed the region &apos;s balance .
Hosni Mubarak , the secular thief who ruled Egypt for 30 years to its fall in 2011 , did not have too much time for Hamas .
instead , the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas brothers and its leaders depend more on popular opinion .
in future diplomatic actions , Hamas may emerge as a player that it cannot exclude , not even Israel and the United States .
meanwhile , Israel &apos;s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion .
as far as the military issue is concerned , they have put Hamas in their place .
Israel &apos;s Iron Missile system has proved its effectiveness , and many of Hamas &apos;s missiles have been destroyed .
the Israelis will see more calm - for some time .
on diplomacy , America is stronger than ever before ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence .
first of all , Israel has been successful , especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has not had too many suicide bombers , partly thanks to the Sunni West Bank barrier , the main piece of an aspiring Palestinian territory to become Palestine , and protects the remaining Jewish settlements , despite the fact that , according to international law , they are illegal .
Mr Netanyahu , whose Likud party has joined a group of an even more hard @-@ headed line in the run @-@ up to the elections on 22 January , is in a good position .
why is it that the Palestinians have been misled by their own state ?
if they did rule in the West Bank , would they not trigger rockets as their compatriots have done in Gaza ?
it is better to have them after that wall and to give them a good blow if they raise their heads .
perhaps the hard wing will be imposed , although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations .
although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much value for Israel , their priority will be to address the internal difficulties .
Israel &apos;s defense budget is higher than that of its four Arab neighbors together .
starting a war with the superpower in the region will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies .
that pragmatic Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something .
Israelis should also think in the long term .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depriving Palestinians of their right to self @-@ determination is to create a powder keg that will one day exploit in Israel &apos;s occupied territories , just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv .
repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demographics make the situation worse as the Arab population increases .
crossed missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll .
both sides need a push from outside the conflict .
the solution remains the one that preach sensible people on both sides , the majority of the outside world and this newspaper : two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons .
the little hope , small in the short term , is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the people who are fighting for this cause .
Egypt , which must start to curb arms entry into Gaza , together with Turkey and Qatar , is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders , with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem .
the Arabs outside the business should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join .
this would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status in the UN .
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table .
during his first term of office , he had to present his own peace plan .
again in the White House , it seems just as reluctant to devote its attention .
this attitude is a deplorable vision for the future .
a stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States .
this involves a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine .
tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases of a green cold , which are the same for all tobacco marks
Australian tobacco and generic packaging law , a pioneer in the world , enters into force , replacing the logists and colours of brands with a packaging of a black @-@ green , appalling images of parts of the body with diseases and representatives of sick children and babies because of the children of parents .
with the exception of the various health warnings and warnings , the only difference between the claims , which has been compulsory since Saturday , is the names of the brands , all of them printed in a small type of source .
it is the most stringent regime in the world applied to packaging of tobacco .
the federal government in Australia claims that the aim is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit gun .
it is relying on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26 , there is 99 % chance of never doing .
&quot; it can be seen that children , even at the very early age , understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand , &quot; said the federal health minister , T@@ ya P@@ liber@@ k , citing studies that showed , for example , that girls linked the logo of a krona with the idea of being a pr@@ as@@ er .
despite the fact that Australia has one of the world &apos;s lowest @-@ smoking rates , and that these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much , other countries are considering taking similar measures .
the tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law .
tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black market of tobacco , in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible .
&quot; the legislation will have serious unintended consequences , &quot; said Scott Mc@@ In@@ re , the British American Tobacco , in Australia .
it will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring the counterfeiters of China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia .
others say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law .
San@@ ra has had a small family company of Z@@ ty P@@ t@@ d , a small family enterprise , claiming that the demand for silicone @-@ p@@ acks and silicone to plug the unpleasant images of the chips had fired almost from two months ago , when the British American Tobacco , Marianne &apos;s Imperial Tobacco , Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a bill in the law in Australia &apos;s Supreme Court .
she said that Z@@ ano had sold up to 6 000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was waiting for more stocks .
&quot; for us it is good business . &quot;
according to the experts , the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed .
after a series of Australian laws that prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sports and force the majority of sellers to do not put cigarettes in sight , the marketing of tobacco is taking place online .
Australia has banned Internet advertising for local companies and websites , but it cannot restrict it on foreign pages .
&quot; if you trade tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products , the online space is the most convincing place to be , &quot; said Bec@@ ky Fre@@ eman , the public health research of Sydney .
Fre@@ eman observed an increase in returns on brands from &quot; ordinary citizens &quot; published on Web pages of social networks such as YouTube , Twitter , and Facebook .
we have to ask ourselves whether it is only a private citizen who really likes the Mar@@ l@@ b@@ b@@ gold cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any marketing company is behind this .
the British American Tobacco in Australia indicated that industry focuses more on what new regulations implies than on marketing .
the industry has even been paying for Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to use the new rules ; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is unfairly restricted , even though none of these countries has a significant trade volume with Australia .
the WTO is likely to dictate a resolution in mid @-@ 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k claimed that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging .
in 2001 , Canada became the first country to make it compulsory to include pictures on the shelves .
they are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries , including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India are considering tougher laws .
in Australia , many smokers are challenging .
&quot; photographs do not affect me .
I simply do not do so . &apos;
&quot; you are on the cigarette , and you have the package , &quot; says Victor El H@@ age while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth .
&quot; frankly , there is only one reason why it would stop smoking : by my daughter . &quot;
James Y@@ u , the manager of the King of the Pack at the center of Sydney , suggests that the uniforms are making it more difficult to fill them on the shelves .
&quot; normally it took an hour to perform a surrender ; now four , &quot; says Y@@ u .
&quot; the government should have banned smoking completely , and then , it is worth it , it is finished and close to the shop , &quot; says as long as the hands raise its hands .
in a constantly connected world , it is not so badly poisoned a bit .
during the course of this year &apos;s action day , I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which we were flying was a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to come .
so I had a great deal of time in which to think about the torch .
I am not going to lie .
by half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to come , it is rather boring , even if you have the means to be handed over , such as books , magazines or I@@ P@@ ons , not forgetting the duty @-@ free shops .
but more and more scholars and child @-@ development experts like to praise the pain &apos;s good .
according to them , it is a good thing that we and our children have been boring from time to time .
the brain is forced to look for interesting choices , and it may encourage creativity .
given that the majority of us are currently connected to this or that screen , we do not experience the benefits that the torch provides .
so , should we be happy to take a shot in the sand ?
yes .
and not .
but we will talk about that later .
first of all , like many people , it was supposed that , now that we have more time for leisure , the torch would be a relatively recent phenomenon .
but , as Peter Tom@@ he@@ y , the Greek and Roman History University of Cal@@ ar@@ y , in Canada , and author of the book &quot; Bor@@ a Day : to Li@@ v@@ ence , a vibrant history &quot; published in 2011 by Yale &apos;s Yale , is not the case .
&quot; in fact , the torch story is very extensive , &quot; he says .
there is already a Latin American walls in Latin America on the torch that dates from the first century .
we must also ask ourselves how we define the torch .
&quot; the problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways , &quot; indicates John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , a professor of the University of York in Onyszkiewicz , Canada .
after examining the reports published and raising the idea of a 100 @-@ man @-@ based discussion group , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues defined the torch as the experience of &quot; wanting but not power , participating in an activity that fills you . &quot;
he says that the difference between the torch and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do so .
it points out that , with apathy , there is no desire to do something .
the main experience of the headscarf , it states , is &quot; the disruption of the care process , associated with a low @-@ mood and a sense that time is moving slowly . &quot;
the headscarf may sound terribly similar to depression .
however , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood says that , although they may be related , people who are boring tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world , while the people who are depressed believe that the problem is one of them .
sometimes we think that we are boring , when what is actually happening is that we have problems in concentrating .
in his study &quot; The Un@@ ha@@ ag@@ ed Min@@ al : De@@ op@@ ing Bor@@ a de jure &quot; , published in September &apos;s edition of the Review magazine on the &quot; Science magazine &quot; Science , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues moved to an earlier experiment in which the participants heard an tape of a person who read the article in a magazine .
some groups heard in the nearby room a TV program that was not kept to any relationship , others heard about the low volume , so it was hardly perceptible , while the third group did not listen to the House at any time .
the group that listened to the program with the volume low showed greater pain than the two other groups ; it cost them to focus , but they were not sure why , and attributed it to the headscarf .
&quot; when you want to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task , the disruption of attention can lead to the hard time , &quot; indicated Mark J. F@@ en@@ ke , a neuro@@ scientist professor at 11 000 , and one of the authors of the study .
&quot; on the other hand , when you are doing something boring , like detecting defective parts in a manufacturing line , a music that is distracted by you can help you to get you got . &quot;
&quot; indeed , we are currently aware that moving or making rates , actions that are often interpreted as a headscarf , can actually help to combat it , as they make the person physically more alert . &quot;
&quot; research shows that those children who are allowed to move further learn more and have more information than those that are forced to stand , &quot; he says Professor F@@ th@@ ke .
we all know what is being raised at some point : the delay of an aircraft , a mono@@ or@@ ite speaker , a particularly boring film .
but some people are more likely to appear than others .
in order to help measure it , some researchers developed in the 1980 &quot; s a &quot; peak @-@ trend scale . &quot;
the scale includes issues like &quot; many of the things that I have to do are repetitive , &quot; and &quot; there are so many things that I do not have time to do everything . &quot;
Stephen B@@ ann@@ d@@ ich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida , claims that , by using these scales , researchers have found that children are more often tired than girls , and particularly need more diverse and more varied stimulation .
but , generally , teenagers are a kind of group that is very easily boring .
in 1991 , Re@@ ed Lar@@ are , a professor of human development and community at the University of Illinois , carried out an experiment in which it was in contact with 400 teenagers and with their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search .
he found that 32 % of adolescents said that he would be boring while he was at school or doing duties , while 23 % said that he would be boring when he was not at school .
on the other hand , 3 % of parents said that they would be boring .
Professor Lar@@ son said that he did not know whether the present @-@ time percentages , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
but he said that what he did know was that &quot; adolescence is a period in which the torch reaches its highest heights , &quot; largely because both children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do .
so , turning to my question of the principle : is it a good thing to have got ?
sometimes it is not , since it is at the end that we are exposing ourselves to absurd physical risks , such as making gambling or falling into the use of substances as a method of combating it , as research is shown .
on the other hand , many philosophers and writers are talking about the connection between the torch and the creativity , as claimed by Professor Vo@@ d@@ ich , who has been looking at this for more than two decades .
&quot; the nerve is the way the brain has to tell them that they would have to do otherwise , &quot; says Gary Mar@@ us , the University of New York University professor .
but the brain does not always know what is most appropriate .
if you are boring and using that energy to touch the z@@ it@@ ra or cooking , that will satisfy you .
but if you are on television , you may be happy to satisfy you in the short term , but not in the long term .
&quot; so , if your son is boring and you have an i@@ ad , you may no longer boring , but you will not have learned to be kept by yourself or to a matter in place , &quot; says Professor F@@ en@@ ke .
and &quot; that capacity for fraud is applied to other situations , &quot; he points out .
your son not only learns to be left alone , but learn to better control in other areas .
I do not think that we really want to praise the nerve .
but we should not be too critical of it .
rather , our aim should be to feel comfortable in the constant rumour of activities and technologies .
Professor E@@ ast@@ wood is in agreement .
&quot; in our view , we need to have more , but the torch is an overly distressing and disturbing desire to link with something worth it worth , &quot; he claims .
it points out that what people really seek is a way to shut down and enjoy a time dead .
&quot; in an environment in which we are constantly over@@ encouraged , &quot; he says , &quot; it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops . &quot;
Colorado : no instructions for the new Act on marijuana consumption
in a 19 @-@ year @-@ old student in a European and South @-@ East Colorado group in a community and a criminal process , he faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the entire state : the possession of marijuana stones and a pi@@ sa that he used to smoke .
it says that one day in September , he and some friends were driving for Lam@@ ar , on the plains close to the border of Kansas , when he stopped them .
the police found marijuana in the car , and a while later in force , he received a judicial court for possession of drugs and related items ( child offences involving each one $ 100 fine ) in which he was informed of the date of trial .
&quot; they treat us like criminals , &quot; he says .
and are they ?
in the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalisation of the holding of small @-@ scale marijuana for recreational use , the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug @-@ holding is less dependent than the law than the location .
hundreds of minor marijuana offences are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington , where a similar measure was adopted .
the police departments have ceased to present charges against the old 21 @-@ year @-@ old possession , which will be legally adopted once the law has entered into force in the next few weeks .
but the prosecutors of more conservative districts of Colorado have committed to continuing the cases open to marijuana , and are still quoting people .
at the same time , several cities , from the suburbs of Denver to Western mountains , are voting to prevent newly authorised marijuana stores from being opened in their communities .
&quot; all of this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be next , he said Daniel J. O@@ ates , chief of police in A@@ am@@ ora , just the east of Denver .
those who deal with regulations in the state of Washington are also going round the issue .
and they continue to seek advice to establish a system of licences for production , manufacture , distribution and sale - all before the deadline , 1 December 2013 .
they say that , for better or for worse , Colorado is ahead of a majority of states in terms of regulation of marijuana use , first for surgical purposes , and now for recreational use .
&quot; Colorado has a more regulated market , so it will be a good guide , &quot; says Brian E. Smith , the spokesman of the state alcohol control Commission in Washington .
but Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions as to what could work .
&quot; there is no real precedent to serve us as a model , &quot; he says .
the law of Washington called I @-@ 5@@ 02 comes into force on 6 December , which also leaves a year during which the licensing system in this state will not yet exist , but the possession will be legal .
in addition , there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period , such as how to maintain a balance between the state &apos;s requirement to provide &quot; adequate access &quot; to authorised marijuana and its ban on cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres of schools , parks , child gambling , or children &apos;s centres .
&quot; nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorised cannabis business than in urban areas , especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle , &quot; says Ben Electric , spokesperson for the Centre for legal cannabis , a newly created research group .
on 21 November , Ol@@ rates , the A@@ am@@ ora police chief , sent an e @-@ mail to his police officers in which he reported that the city prosecutor would no longer take legal proceedings for soft marijuana in people over the age of 21 , and that the police would no longer present charges against such crimes &quot; with immediate effect . &quot;
the chief of police said that they would be responsible for enforcing the rules of the city that regulate the use of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug traffickers and sellers .
in the county of W@@ feld , in the north of Colorado , the district prosecutor , Ken bu@@ ick , represents a stricter view .
after the vote , he ensured that his office would continue to pursue the cases of marijuana possession , mainly to put pressure on consumers and to be decided to be treated .
currently , 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less marijuana , although many of them have other charges .
&quot; our office has the obligation to take legal action against those failures that at the time they were a crime , &quot; said Mr B@@ ick in a statement .
the answer has been complicated even in places like the rural county of Bureau , where voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of marijuana .
the police from the G@@ and June College , the largest county in the county , no longer quote adults by possession of small quantities .
the county prosecutor &apos;s tax in the county council supported this decision , but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding cases .
&quot; I do not think that he is wasting time in continuing to enforce the law until he changes , &quot; he said .
despite the fact that 55 % of voters supported the measure , it was never considered that taking marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy .
the contradictory reactions that arise from the state as a whole reveal a marked ambivalence among officials in relation to the great environmental experiment in this state .
&quot; it is a cultural barrier with the prosecutors in the district , &quot; claims Mc@@ Allister , a Denver lawyer representing defendants for marijuana possession , and who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana law .
&quot; they have spent so long bringing people before the courts who , in fact , still cannot accept that it is legal , &quot; he said .
as the first states to consider small quantities of marijuana in the same way as alcohol , Colorado , and Washington are preparing to become the national test cases in the legalisation of drugs .
as long as lawyers and officials of the state have a new border of legal sales , they also expect to receive indications from the federal government , which still provides for regard for marijuana sales and cultivation as federal crimes .
the advocates of marijuana legalization hope that the Department of Justice will give up .
while some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana sellers have been produced for therapeutic purposes , the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses for these purposes in Colorado , Washington , and 16 more states .
&quot; although anti @-@ drug agents are unlikely to throw out a small drug bag , they are likely to be reluctant to allow regulated stores by the state for recreational use for recreational use , allowed in the new law , &quot; said K@@ emi A. Ser@@ et , a former anti @-@ drug policy adviser to Obama &apos;s administration .
several city of Colorado does not wait for the federal authorities to act .
even before the election day , some local governments passed a moratorium on any new marijuana stores , even though it will be around a year before any of them can open .
last week , a six @-@ month ban was adopted in the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ a , and it is likely to be approved next week .
&quot; we do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorise someone , and then we have a major problem at a federal level , &quot; explained Bob Nicholson , a member of the council .
&quot; our community voted against this amendment .
we are looking into what the community voted against in favour of what the state voted &apos; .
there are many questions that arise in this regard .
Pe@@ on@@ ella W@@ y@@ at@@ t : &quot; I harassed to the Oxford of Oxford for being a Tor@@ y . &quot;
the university is not attacked for its views only now .
I do not recall any moment in my life in which I have not been dreaming of getting a square at Oxford University .
both my father and my older brother had been the best place in the world to learn , a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilisation : free thinking and tolerance .
however , the two weeks in which I had my square in the Work College at the end of the 1980s to make up the history of history had already done their bags , triggering the first scandal of my life .
my father collapsed and cries out .
my friends were puzzled .
the newspaper The E@@ ven@@ ing newspaper claimed that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate a number of colleagues from university holding sex in the room .
the writer A. N@@ - Wilson announced joke that he had gone because he forced me to drink in qu@@ uc@@ ons .
the truth was less amusing .
it was there .
yes , I fled , because he had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation .
not because of my bizarre name , or the fact that it was not a private school .
they harassed me for a single reason , which at the cradle of the supposed illustration was something intolerant and barbaric : my father , the late W@@ ag@@ hr@@ d W@@ y@@ at@@ t , was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher , and I supported the conservative party .
perhaps you would ask what is happening now .
well , several reports suggest that a new generation of center @-@ right students is suffering a similar persecution .
the institutionalized and growing hatred towards students of the Conservative Party is such that last week a group of them called for the same level of equal rights as homosexuals , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
conservative members of the J@@ PC ( graduate student grouping ) of the in @-@ the @-@ court College say that they are &quot; often seriously paragraphs , personally attacked and treated as non @-@ com@@ ar@@ te people &quot; for their political ideas .
they want to create a seat on their college of equal opportunities for their university college in order to ensure that they can express their views freely .
their situation has not been encouraged by a recent documentary of the B@@ B@@ 2 so @-@ called &quot; W@@ on@@ der@@ land : Y@@ oun@@ g , Bri@@ right and on the Ri@@ right &quot; ( El paradise : young , brilliant , and right ) on student politics and presented to the Tat@@ es@@ as and neo @-@ Nazis .
he showed the early student Joe Co@@ o@@ ke , former President of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University ( O@@ AS@@ A ) , in a Pon@@ ls @-@ Pon@@ ce , wearing a silver suit and a stick with the silver bullet .
in other universities , conservative students say that they are treated as &quot; Turkish heads &quot; by the introduction of higher tuition fees .
Lu@@ ke Black , 20 , and vice @-@ president of the Conservative Party &apos;s Conservative Association Association declared in a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there is a growing left @-@ wing trend in universities .
people are assuming that we are like the B@@ us@@ v@@ don Club without even knowing us . &quot;
Samuel minarets , 21 years and a student of history on the assumption that he tabled the motion for increased protection , states that this environment is &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; whereas the 19 @-@ year @-@ old St@@ ag@@ ll Ch@@ er@@ ll and President @-@ elect of the O@@ SE , claims that the attitude of the J@@ PC &apos;s members to those of the center @-@ right people has worsened .
&quot; this poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate , as well as for the well @-@ being of the members , &quot; he says .
during my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one .
I entered the university in September 1986 , he was a young age of 18 terribly timid .
the hatred of the Conservative Party was at its top .
the year before , the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher , a former student , a &quot; outstanding cause &quot; title after cuts in the funding of higher education .
the atmosphere would have made it shocking any Stalinist .
already during the first days of welcome to new universities , when the new students know about and know the professors , I received a sample of the bitterness that I was expecting .
I discovered that teachers were not only turning a blind eye to conservative university graduates , but were very much involved in it .
the policy of the miners &apos; strike , privatisation and opposition from the government to the anti @-@ apartheid sanctions in South Africa came to the seminar rooms of the seminar .
the first I attended were to translate French texts from the eighteenth century and I was not prepared to follow .
&quot; say W@@ y@@ at@@ t , &quot; said the professor Harry Pittella ( already late ) , &quot; please translate the first paragraph . &quot;
I did not .
Pittella , a low man with a face that seemed to be a mass of bizarre , was well aware of how to expel bad bi@@ is .
&quot; is it that the th@@ at@@ ists refuse to learn French , or is they simply stupid ? &quot; he asked .
the other university graduates took place .
I was fascinated by the tears that we were trying to contain .
&quot; I suggest that he goes to French in his free time , as long as it is not too busy knowing people , &quot; a bunch of Pittella .
I returned to my room as a soul .
that night I was only at the dinner at the university , then I felt a slight smile on the back .
he was a second @-@ year English student called James , who was presented as a member of the O@@ AS@@ A .
&quot; I know who you are , &quot; he kindly told me .
&quot; I fear that that is how it is going to be .
anyone who is suspected of being Tor@@ y will be put in place .
for me it is very complicated , but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be even worse for you .
many Tallinn is only newcomers . &quot;
then , in a local do@@ b , I tried to hide .
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said .
that trick proved useless .
a first @-@ year student of Fi@@ lo@@ ul@@ a , policies and economics that he paradoxically studied in E@@ ton , said : &quot; you are the daughter of a fascist pig .
you are contaminated . &apos;
other students took that foreign office .
I became a dirty dirty thing .
&apos;@@ How do sexual relations have sex ? &apos; asked one .
&quot; you beat one another , don &apos;t ? &quot;
I felt in the same way that homosexuals should have been felt before the liberal law of the 1960s .
could one day take a normal life in Oxford ?
would I be forced to remain with people who think I think they would be only after they were on their feet ?
would you want me to be Labour and to suppress my natural trends ?
the three years that I was expected to have been presented as a br@@ ac@@ ant of ostracism and isolation .
the only openly Tor@@ ly Tor@@ y era was divine S@@ tone , a professor of Con@@ temporary History aimed at my university college .
he hated him for being not only the Conservative Party , but also Thatcher &apos;s adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches .
it was barely there .
I had the place that he considered it to be provincial and insignificant , and for his adherence to the Marxist @-@ feudal vision of history .
in 1997 , he agreed to a chair at the University of B@@ k@@ ent University in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; you are not going to be happy , &quot; he told me .
I began to travel daily from Oxford on a daily basis from my parents in London , finding refuge in my family members and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality .
I told my father who hated Oxford and why .
I did not think so .
when he studied there in the years , all the political points of view were accepted .
&quot; but if it is the best place in the world , &quot; he said with sadness .
&quot; they never would do that , not among my dream needle .
even my Communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude . &quot;
their painful eyes began to fade .
&apos;@@ give you another opportunity .
I am sure that they have done so only to joke .
I would be left with the heart if I left it for the sake of it . &quot;
exhausted by so many trips to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
a friend of mine , who also supported the Conservative Party , had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed .
the next week , during a seminar in which another professor of History had hinted , speaking very seriously , that I was an &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
Red of shame for us , I admitted that my parents had &quot; mis@@ laundering the brain &quot; and called them &quot; stupid old . &quot;
the truce was short @-@ lived .
it was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford .
at the time my father was writing two weekly columns in the Murdoch press .
my door was closed with key .
I was inside every fear and , in the past five minutes , my followers abandoned .
when I went wrong and hosted the first train to London .
I never returned .
perhaps you will call me a weak song .
but no 18 @-@ year @-@ old person should be subjected to such intimidation and hostility in an educational institution .
what is even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only formed the first 14 of the Conservative Party ministers , but is now hiding behind a reputation , which is nothing , deserved to be equal and free of thought .

the most hard @-@ working world in the world : the lives of K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en
for four euros , the Indonesian volcano operators are playing life and health by charging 70 kg of sulphur through a set of stone paths .
there are people for whom their job is a hell , and another that is literally working in hell .
this is the case of An@@ to Wijsenbeek , one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by removing sulphur from the volcano K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en , to the east of the Indonesian island of Jos .
to do so , it needs to reduce every day to the bottom of its bottom line , where the sul@@ fur@@ ous gas emanating from the Earth &apos;s core gas is strengthened by entering into contact with the air .
after cutting large sulphur rocks , which in total reach some 70 kg , it entails them in two b@@ od@@ o of b@@ od@@ o , which is a burden on their shoulders through p@@ aking paths of stone .
it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which amounts to 2.@@ 3@@ 86 metres , but the exhausted driving gear takes more than 40 minutes into a snail &apos;s pace at a snail &apos;s pace , balancing the balance and measuring its steps not to slip down and fall down the cliff .
they know that any crossing could cost them their lives , as a French tourist who took off the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ ah years ago for years ago .
K@@ aw@@ ah &apos;s miners earn five euro cents for every kilo of sulphur that they draw .
once above , moves are opened among tourists who photo @-@ picking as if we were circus @-@ keepers and , with the heavy hands of heavy traders , walk three kilometers to the balance that a non @-@ mining company has placed a little lower , to 1.@@ 850 metres .
it is the PT Can@@ di N@@ é@@ im@@ bi , a company which , since 1960 , exploited the volcano and , never better , its workers , to whom it pays 6@@ 62 Indonesians ( 5 cents ) for every kilo of sulphur .
it then sells it for 10 000 euro oil ( 83 euro cents ) to the offshore oil industry , since this ore is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture , fireworks , cosmetics , dynam@@ ite , and even to repair sugar .
&quot; as normal is to charge 70 kilograms , we have obtained a figure of 4@@ 6,000 ( EUR 3.8 ) on each journey , &quot; explains An@@ to , who usually makes three daily reports .
it takes three hours in each of them and ends up , but it allows it to be put on to the tune of a total of 13@@ 8,000 ru@@ pi@@ es ( EUR 1@@ 1.5 ) at the end of the day .
although it would appear to be a pittance for such an inhumane effort , it is three times more than it would gain from the countryside .
&quot; the miners of the miners are very high here , where the harvest of coffee is paid to 15 000 col@@ s ( EUR 1.2 ) and the average monthly wage is two million ru@@ bles ( EUR 167 ) , &quot; clarifies the portfolio , which was previously used as an accident in the island of Bali .
there , his salary was at 75 000 euros ( EUR 6.@@ 2 ) , and that was not so hard , but An@@ to@@ w@@ w@@ i , a people close to the volcano , has returned with his family , for a reason of weight that , in Indonesia , is as strong as the sulphur : &quot; I married a young girl from Bali , where they are Hindu , and brought it to J@@ va to turn Islam into Islam . &quot;
An@@ us has asthma , breathing with difficulty , constantly and angry with the eyes of the toxic gases .
to his 27 @-@ year @-@ old , An@@ to is three playing the skin in the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ in , whose sulphur has already begun to pass the bill , despite covering its face with special colours and glasses .
it has asthma , breathing with difficulty , constantly and angry at the toxic gases that the volcano has fired .
that is the price to be paid for their dream .
&quot; I will work two years longer because I want to open a Spanish or Spanish or French shop , &quot; he promises in English more than acceptable .
punished for life , this clever and intelligent young might be a tourist guide , shrimp or reception of a hotel , but instead it does the work of a mu@@ el .
by sharing a cage of wood with a other portfolio , it is raised every day at the next two hours because sulphur does not stop night , when its yellow colour is blue and conspicuous in the midst of darkness .
in defiance of the shadows , it was in the run @-@ up to the grain that it had bought off its money with its money , which it has bought with its money .
some 400 e@@ e@@ ers bear sulphur on their shoulders from the premium fund .
despite its huge benefits , the mining company has not made the extraction of sulphur to save costs and supply no equipment to the driving operators , who work for its own , and thus to the weight .
indeed , they do not even see some of a 30 @-@ year @-@ of @-@ the @-@ house fee ( EUR 2.5 ) , which , along with 15 000 euro @-@ 1.2 ( EUR 1.2 ) , is paid to tourists who come to lecture the volcano and their human lives .

able to raise up to 110 kg , it ensures that it will stand up for &quot; everything that it can &quot; because it needs the money to educate its three children , between 18 and 10 years .
I will not retire , I will die here because the volcano has been my life .
even though sulphur is burning up and hiding our eyes when the wind is short and caught to the miners in the columns of the volcano , they are so hard that none of them are suffering from serious diseases - beyond , of course , their usual respiratory problems , ar@@ tro@@ sis , pain of the knees and pain on the shoulders , which have been squandered by the weight of the c@@ box .
Bal@@ zing the basket on its backs , Un@@ is@@ k can no longer charge 50 kg to his 53 @-@ year @-@ old .

Singapore \ u0027s Children &apos;s Economy
bidding blame the race , stress , and cost of property and education for not having children .
&quot; the people of Singapore need to grow . &quot;
I am a patriotic husband , you are my patriotic wife , let us fulfil our civic duty and we believe life !
it may seem unlikely that these incidents will be part of an announcement of m@@ ast@@ ate tablets , but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
phrases are part of a fine that uses local references such as &quot; We will put an in @-@ the @-@ hole ( &quot; t ) a &quot; no &quot; to laugh at the birth rate of Singapore .
the advertising company B@@ B@@ H has hoped that with the announcement it will make a funny effort to draw attention to the problem .
his creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says that he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfil the &quot; their national duty . &quot;
this is something purely of the Internet , so we had to make it fun and amusing .
that is the biggest problem in the country .
we are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves , so we feel that this was an issue that we had to address .
we knew that the government had tried to do a lot of things , like launching a month @-@ olds or fast @-@ listing , or to organise rapid quotes .
many of these ideas may have been creative , but not necessarily worked .
so we think , why do we not make the most creative possible solution to solving this problem , which is to set up a rubber stamp ?
1.2 Children
it is the Singapore government that does not take it so lightly .
it spends $ 1.3 per year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children .
a government package for marriages and parents gives up to $ 15 000 per child , extends maternity licences and distribute tax benefits .
but all of this has had little effect .
Singapore is a rich and high @-@ tech state in Southeast Asia , also known by the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
the birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , is currently set in 1.2 children per woman .
the last time it was above 2 - known as the return rate - it was in 1976 .
so why do they not have any more children ?
so Wei M@@ ing , the National Population Division Family Policy director , says that it is due to &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a wider range of career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; that has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities , beyond marriage and training a family , &quot; he explains .
these changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the bar and to delaying marriage and births , resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
meanwhile , an immigration policy that is at the forefront of dramatically increasing immigration to address the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population .
in Singapore there are websites where xenophobia is in abundance barely disguised by many new immigrants , particularly the Chinese , who are critical of maintaining low wages and not being integrated .
the increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral result last year since independence .
since the elections , there has been an attempt to rectify the problem , with higher quotas and charges for foreign workers .
unexpected consequences
while the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation &apos;s economic growth , tax revenues , health costs , and immigration policies , the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences .
the government is trying to ensure that so many small houses are not built .
for example , it has started to affect the housing sector .
the urban development authority has moved to control the number of small flats known as &quot; shoes of shoes , &quot; which can be built in certain areas of the city .
these flats have an area of 46 square metres and have had a great deal of success .
however , there are concerns that they will be able to promote a life @-@ like style and discourage developers who want to build large , family @-@ run houses .
but L@@ im Y@@ sis So@@ on , a general head of the property company EL EL , says that his &quot; boxes of shoes &quot; are sold much faster than larger units .
they are more popular , in the sense that units run out of days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
that makes it much better for our cash flow .
however , it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers , who have been hampered in the past if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project .
too stressed
Singapore is a state city .
while these new rules may be a step towards raising the national birth rate , speaking with the hard @-@ pressed alternatives that work in the center &apos;s financial district , it seems that they will not have much effect .
&quot; people are very stressed , homes are expensive , and so is education , so many people are postponing it , &quot; he says a young executive .
others may have children .
&quot; but it is important for me to have my own money and time , &quot; he says another 20 years .
men and women mention their career , stress , and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children .
so , as long as the government tries to push its citizens to have children , when it is a question of making babies , it is those who have the final say .
private off @-@ line is private on line
privacy .
according to the dictionary of the Royal Royal Academy , we are talking about the quality of private or &apos; the area of private life that is entitled to protect from any interference &apos; .
what is private for a 16 @-@ year @-@ old ?
how does this definition apply in their daily lives and in social networks ?
does it intend the dangers to which the Internet is currently exposed to situations which I would certainly not share from the line ?
in the case of five boys aged between ten and 15 years , frequent users of the network have been held .
in four cases , they associated the term &apos; something very of mine &apos; , on a personal level , and &apos; in the key and name of the user &apos; when they applied it to social networks .
&quot; my deepest secrets would not go down to a post , &quot; he says of ten years , when he tries to explain the meaning of private in sites such as Facebook , Twitter , H@@ ot@@ mail , and Win@@ do@@ ons Li@@ le@@ s@@ ger , where he has been accountable for two years .
&quot; they are very secret secrets , my mother can know them , but not everyone , &quot; he says .
in F@@ B sub@@ or beautiful images or games .
I also have with my well @-@ known people .
&quot; I would not share a photograph that is not mine , or someone who is making ridicule , &quot; he says .
the child recognises that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people , of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments .
George ensures to know the 35 friends who have in F@@ B and its nine followers on Twitter .
most are relatives .
the mother is included , he has the key to one of the accounts .
I opened Twitter to speak and write interesting bills .
&quot; I do not know whether they answer me , I only the sub @-@ or , &quot; he adds .
&quot; social networks are entertaining , I can speak with distant relatives or my friends quickly , &quot; he suggests .
no doubt in answering that I would never accept an application from an unknown person .
it would not be a case for someone who recommended a strange one .
the 14 @-@ year @-@ old case is different .
the teenager has open accounts in H@@ ot@@ mail , Facebook , M@@ , and As@@ k , in the latter admits to 20 of the people added to their list of friends .
&quot; I am not afraid , because we have something in common , music for example , &quot; suggests .
according to the boy , none of him has been hinted at or asked for the direction of his house or his telephone number .
&quot; if I pressed or demanded it , I would simply take it out of my own account , &quot; he recognises .
José was a fan of As@@ k , after reading a recommendation on Twitter .
the experience of what is known today as cyber @-@ cyber is not a matter for the boy .
to a well @-@ known my friend , they were blackmailing it on a social network .
it was threatening and required money .
&quot; it never knew who was , &quot; it ensures .
the victim , according to José , did not close the bill .
&quot; he was put on him only . &quot;
then it explains a number of steps to shape the account safely .
unlike Jorge , this boy would raise pictures of known as uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
I would do so if it falls wrong or I am keen on it .
&quot; although I know that that is cyber , it says .
key questions
the English and graduate teacher in education and education , he believes that the purpose of social networks is to inform children and adolescents .
&quot; the Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these sites , the rules of the game changed , &quot; he mentions .
it is pointed out that the academic Marc Go@@ sky , teachers of teaching by Yale and author of the indigenous workforce and In@@ migrants , coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
the native natives are they , the children and young people who were born with the technology .
&quot; we are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still learning , &quot; he says .
he says that the issue is complex , &quot; because we are asking you to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to spread , publish or say at an age that maturity does not give that . &quot;
&quot; also targeted when what matters most is to be popular , having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences , &quot; adds .
according to the expert , the most effective way of teaching the privacy of children and adolescents is by questions to reflect .
&quot; say that it does not do not serve , &quot; he adds .
then there are a few options available to us : there are things that do not deal with one strange thing , why do you do so on the Internet ?
or would you like them to publish a photograph of you such as the public who is a friend of a friend ?
do you know what the others publish on you ?
when labels photos of holiday , do you give permission to other people to label them ?
and one more , will everyone need to know what they are doing at the moment ?
another point is to make it clear that they must act on line as off line .
they are the same rules .
&quot; one outside the Internet acts with respect , morality , and other principles , just as the social networks , &quot; says .
surveillance
it is important for parents to be aware of social networks &apos; policies on social networks that it is essential for parents to read the policies of social networks .
to understand each of them , they have a solid foundation for talking to their children about the implications of opening an Internet account .
&quot; for example , age and what is permitted to share or publish , &quot; he says .
according to the Guard , it is key to remind children of the lesson of &quot; don &apos;t have them with strangers . &quot;
ending the Lima Declaration
the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union ( Un@@ as@@ ur ) was concluded in Peru today without the Lima Declaration being made public , announced in advance and theoretically signed by the seven elected representatives .
EF@@ E has repeatedly tried to accede to the document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Un@@ as@@ ur , but Federal and Presidency sources pointed out at a start that they would hand over the closure , but then claimed that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian Government &apos;s web .
as they were consulted by the text , they pointed out that the content had been set out by the President of Peru , Oman Humala , during a few brief statements to the press .
the access of journalists to information at the summit was restricted at all times .
during the day , only the sound video of the presidential assembly was passed in the press room , with the message &quot; private sitting , un@@ constrained . &quot;
the little information that has been circulating among reporters was handed over by press spokesmen in some of the governments of the Un@@ as@@ ur assistants at the quotation , though not the Peruvian one .
the only document released during the day was the list of assistants , which caused the unrest of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that demanded higher data .
subsequently , Peru &apos;s presidency sent an e @-@ mail to the media with the summit &apos;s &quot; final declaration &quot; , but it is Humala &apos;s statement , not the official document that closed the summit .
last October , Peru was the host of the Third American @-@ African @-@ Arab Summit , and on that occasion , despite the fact that the press has been required , the Lima Declaration that had previously been announced was not also reported .
the document was published on Tuesday &apos;s official web , which was published on Tuesday .
in both international meetings , the Peruvian authorities tried to provide information systems that were insured to all journalists but made it possible to obtain information as much as possible .
the summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that would address a border dispute between the two countries .
the presidents of Peru , O@@ ret@@ ta Humala , and Chile , Edmund Piñera , met during the regional quotation and ratified that they will respect the decision of the ( CI@@ J ) , which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both sides , in the process that Lima presented against Santiago .
&quot; we will abide by and implement the ruling that defines the differences we are leading today to this international court , &quot; said Humala , along with his Chilean couple .
&quot; Chile has been , is and will continue to be a country that respects international law , the peaceful solution of disputes , of treaties , and of international courts , &quot; he added , and welcomed Humala &apos;s hand in hand with Humala , along with the flags of the two countries .
the confirmation of both presidents that it will be submitted to the CI@@ J then happened that Colombia would be denouncing the Bogota Pact this week on which it had agreed to submit to the failures of that international court , following a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua , which was seriously flawed .
the summit was conducted with Brazil &apos;s presidents , Dilma Rouhani ; Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , Bolivia , Evo Morales ; and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
Paraguay , suspended from Un@@ as@@ ur since 2011 , following the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lu@@ go , did not participate in the quotation .
the host President , O@@ s@@ ta Humala , was the job to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit , shortly after midday in Lima .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office read the final document in which it reported that 16 agreements were adopted and action lines were set for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of $ 17 billion in investments .
among the agreements adopted , it mentioned that the UN@@ AS@@ R@@ CO@@ CO@@ s countries will make a &apos; major steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship , for which we are extending the agreements on residence &apos; .
it reported that action is being taken to improve &apos; cooperation in the fight against citizens &apos; insecurity and against cross @-@ border organised crime , to make medicines more accessible , access to low @-@ price Internet in all corners of South America , and to meet the risks of natural disasters jointly and efficiently . &apos;
with a Europe in crisis , &quot; economic consolidation ( from Latin America ) should not have a triumphant parent , but should serve to widen productive parent and see a better future for our peoples , &quot; added Humala .
&quot; we have decided to give preference to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the Southern American spaces , especially in rural and border areas - uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits , &quot; said the Peruvian president in a message read .
among these projects , he mentioned that five are to Peru , and are located on the cross @-@ cutting lines of their territory , from the coast to Brazil , and two points to greater connection with Ecuador , although it did not give even greater details .
the final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay .
&quot; we hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to restore the Union of South American Nations , which is currently excluded .
the need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace , integrated , and good neighbourly relations , was another of the issues highlighted by the summit .
in this sense , Colombia &apos;s president John Manuel Santos said before he began his participation in the regional quotation that he hoped to meet with his or her couple of Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday , in Mexico , to treat in the aftermath of the sea row after the CI@@ J ruling , questioned by Bogota .
&quot; morning ( Saturday ) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega , &quot; he said .
&quot; we will review all these paths , they are not exclusive , even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua , &quot; he emphasized .
&quot; with President Ortega , I hope to be able to tell him that we manage this in the most civilised and respectful way , &quot; Santos added .
Santos and Ortega will be in Mexico on Saturday where they intend to attend the new president of that country , Enrique Peña Nieto .
likewise , as part of the summit , block defence ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Nigeria , Guyana , South Africa and Paraguay , even if the last country is suspended .
Peru has the Swedish pro @-@ bloc presidency .
&quot; South America must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship &quot; : Raphael to
the president of Ecuador , Raphael , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which &quot; South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . &quot;
Correa , who took part in the sixth @-@ century presidential summit in Lima , declared state TV that Europeans were &quot; killed in World War II &quot; and in other conflicts , &quot; but now they are practically a homeland . &quot;
in this respect , he defended the project to establish American citizenship which is encouraged by the member countries of Un@@ as@@ ur .
&quot; we need to ensure the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country , as is already the case with those in the Andean Community , but there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past , &quot; he warned .
the Organization of American States ( OAS ) was also in favour of the re @-@ establishment of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo @-@ Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Pact on human rights .
the people who stand up never commit themselves and , instead , we in the United States have signed up to it all .
&quot; it is incomprehensible that the Inter @-@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States , &quot; stated in the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange .
Correa ensured that he is not sorry about that decision , because he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his &quot; profound democratic values and human rights . &quot;
he added that , at the time , &quot; there were justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and did not respect its process . &quot;
he also criticised Swedish justice for calling for the questioning of alleged sexual crime on its territory when &apos; the Swedish law itself allows it to be done by video conference , which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London &apos; .
Correa said that there is a risk that Assange &apos;s physical and mental health will deteriorate .
&quot; I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy , but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem , &quot; nothing serious &quot; , said the A@@ au@@ ot@@ ano .
what is in fact is the danger that their physical and mental health will deteriorate as a result of being locked in a small space without any free air .
&quot; that complicates the health of any person , &quot; he added .
corrections to the fact that the solution to asylum given to Assange since June at the Official Embassy in London , by granting a rescue that allows it to travel to Ecuador , is in the hands of Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the WikiLeaks founder .
we do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been permanent talks .
&quot; the solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange &apos;s lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ ar Gar@@ z@@ on , is making a series of procedures in different European bodies , &quot; he mentioned .
and he argued that , &quot; if Britain gives the way tomorrow , it ends up . &quot;
and if Sweden , as well , is allowing its legislation and as it has done in other cases , questioning Mr Assange in the Ecuador &apos;s embassy in London , or the question of what is happening in London tomorrow , is the end of the problem .
Correa used to assert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and nuanced that what it does not tolerate is &quot; mediocrity , bad faith , and lie , which distort freedom of expression . &quot;
&quot; the greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and evil politicians , but bad journalists on the basis of profit , blackmail , and extortion , &quot; he said .
in that respect , it was welcomed that no such journalists are no longer &quot; either the bankers nor the hegemonic countries or countries that dominate Ecuador , &quot; and pre @-@ empt that they will be re @-@ elected &quot; to deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction . &quot;
Correa also supported the decision to hold Paraguay &apos;s veto at least until his next election , arguing that the body &quot; must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and rule of legality &quot; because in reality it &quot; destroyed the legitimacy of de facto democracy . &quot;
the Italian president , moreover , considered &quot; perfectly relevant &quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart , John Manuel Santos , to negotiate with Nicaragua the sea limits between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , which benefited the regional sovereignty of Nicaragua .
for the time being , this failure is not taken .
it is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country .
conflicts are inevitable , but they must be overcome by the will to walk together .
they need to be processed extensively to overcome them and to go ahead .
he also relied on a good conclusion to the sea @-@ line dispute that maintained in the same Peru and Chile , and argued that &quot; it is right for Latin America to look for international institutions if the two countries commit themselves to failing to fail hard . &quot;
referring to the eventuality that is present as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to look for a third consecutive term , he pointed out that he sees that possibility &quot; with a great deal of optimism and joy , though sometimes rather hard . &quot;
Correa ensured that if he loses the elections in February 2013 , he will withdraw from public life .
I have never had an interest in power , but in such unfair situations as Ecuador , socio @-@ economic poverty can only be corrected from political power .
&quot; my personal movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory , because we have to accept that re@@ pon@@ ent , &quot; he said .
winning it would be my last period in the presidency and that is why we came out of public life .
if we lose the same .
&quot; it &apos;s a decision , &quot; he said .
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez &apos;s new health treatment in Cuba .
I have just been talking to the Vice @-@ President Venezuelan Vice @-@ President Nicholas Maduro and told me that he travelled to a treatment that was already planned , routine , for the campaign to return to Cuba .
&quot; it does not mean a relapse into the state of health of President Chávez , &quot; he commented .
the Deputy Head of State in Lima today took part in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( Un@@ as@@ ur ) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
AIDS deaths today : late detection
F@@ Open A had 21 years of age when they confirmed the result of the test : positive AIDS .
&quot; it was as if I fell a bomb , &quot; referring to the timing of the announcement , that the doctor was trying to make the &quot; more shot , &quot; without a clear success .
the boy kept him off to his family .
he decided to take care of his illness alone , and began to be informed about it ; with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his birthday .
it is , of course , one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of Gu@@ eg@@ aj@@ ara ( H@@ C@@ G ) , which was arrived at in 1994 after several battles .
IVF lives with the virus of human immune ( HIV ) for 22 years , which is hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s , when there were many doubts , few options for treatment and more stigma .
even the director of an ILO clinic , then , prevented him from crying out of him , &quot; because he had a cut . &quot;
then , having AIDS was synonymous with death .
it is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life .
yet , ignorant of its disease , many people arrive when the virus has already inflicted havoc , &quot; exhausted &quot; its immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections .
to 31 years of the world &apos;s appearance of AIDS , at least of the first reported cases , &quot; the great achievement means at the moment that an patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and over @-@ life of the general population , is exactly the same , &quot; indicated the head of the H@@ C@@ G &apos;s HIV Unit , Jaime An@@ ra@@ de Vi@@ w@@ al@@ eva , after referring that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication .
the Andean Science and AIDS expert in HIV / AIDS commented that , since 2008 , scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment , but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of understanding of the immune system presented by patients with a better expectation for those who are not drug users , of up to 30 years of a 200 @-@ year @-@ old 30 @-@ year @-@ old age when they report 500 M@@ 4 years .
in simple words , that means that whoever receives a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age , under these terms , &quot; will be able to live smoothly up to the age of 75 , &quot; explained the interviewed .
in order to reduce this progress , it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average .
although mortality has fallen significantly in recent years , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6.@@ 6@@ 78 cases in 2007 to 4.@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 ( UN @-@ based annual report ) , it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS , 60 % of patients at national data base have died .
in 2011 alone 255 people died in 2011 , and are 187 deaths until May of this year ; however , it is guaranteed that there is universal access to anti @-@ retroviral drugs since 2005 .
- Why are deaths still there ?
it seems to me that the problem is not about access to treatment .
that is how we see it , and that has happened to us in our hospital .
at least in the last 12 years we have not been dis@@ burdened with medicine the problem is that patients have been very advanced because they are not aware of their state of infection , that is , in late stages of the disease .
he gave a strong figure : &quot; nine out of ten patients arrive when some opportunistic infection already presents what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality , is to make early diagnosis , and thus have to provide mass detection tests , to all those who require it . &quot;
in his proposal , experts and officials from the State AIDS Prevention Council include patients , such as F@@ eni@@ z@@ o , who turned the test to a particular laboratory , only motivated by a friend and , despite its short age , already at the AIDS stage and even suffered as a carcinogenic tumor that is one of the common complications .
everything changes when you know that you are AIDS .
some people think that they are going to die and they do not want to know .
&quot; if I am already going to die , I am better off three times a week , &quot; they say not in my case .
the change was to improve , well , I do , I take the medicines .
to date , their parents know only that they suffered cancer .
I live a normal life , like anyone else .
&quot; work , I have many activities , I travel , I have an active and active sexual life , and I have lost responsibility to me and to the other person , &quot; listed to share his privacy with a Millennium Millennium to justify his testimony to those who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
if they were at risk , they would have been at risk , even more soon if they were HIV positive , better and if they already have the diagnosis , who learn that they can live like anyone else , being responsible .
that , your message sums up the motto of battle for AIDS this 2012 .

in the places devoted to this task , &apos; the distribution of condoms has indeed increased , you gave us from one or two days now , you give us packages of a hundred , and that is all well and good , but it is still the case that there are still those who , today , have no access to a condom , &apos; he said .
among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
&apos;@@ What do you want us to ? &apos; is a common question , with contempt and judgments of social workers , school promoters , pharmacies employees and health personnel , which the adolescents are not willing to expose , secured by the communicating .
it proposed to redirect this ineffective sharing ; that the condoms are not only behind the experts , and those hundred are in the public gallery of the sites that young people come to .
it is not to motivate the promise .
it is not a question of paying lip service and car to the car , as was answered by the Governor E@@ eli@@ o González , who asked whether it would be a distribution of condoms in his administration .
&quot; so is not sexuality , the best is to bring the condoms to those who already practise sexual activity , &quot; he pointed out .
keys to Sovereignty
there are 1@@ 4@@ 35 accumulated cases ( 12.@@ 158 of AIDS and 1.@@ 3@@ 17 of HIV ) .
the state is 4 ° national in new and accumulated AIDS and 13 ° HIV cases .
92 % of the infection is on the sexual track , 6 % to the blood route , and 2 % on the road .
it is estimated that 50 000 people can be living with HIV because , on a case , there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it .
ratified by a United States appeals court a ruling that ignores the in @-@ the @-@ depth group &apos;s re@@ structure of the vitro group by a commercial competition in Mexico , the scenario puts a bad precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems .
it would therefore appear that the procedures for the survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars , in the face of international conventions .
in practical terms , the backing for the sentence issued on 15 June last year by Judge Har@@ lin Hal@@ al of the bankruptcy court for the northern district of Texas leaves the Mexican firms defenceless against the possibility of their properties in excess of the BOJ .
however , the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the US Supreme Court , citing three inconsistencies .
from the outset , while the judge of the case points out that creditors should be governed by the United States &quot; Qu@@ dark Law , the O@@ ter@@ m@@ , appeals court , based in New Orleans , says that the main procedure is the commercial competition that was dealt with in Mexico .
the first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with national profile .
in fact , to that end , the United Nations Law Model was set up for the uniformity of International P@@ Pensions Law , taking the American L@@ w Institute as a referee .
secondly , the ruling states that without the opt @-@ outs , recognised by the critical mass of the commercial competition , the debts that had with its parent , in vitro , would not have been achieved by the majority required to approve the restructuring .
however , the possibility is recognised by Mexican laws .
in fact , in vitro , that was not the first case to accept the scheme .
there are half a dozen examples of this , including between the ex ante and Business Anti @-@ Fraud Office , whose debts have been supported by the interbank Federal Institute .
the fact is that it is that , by undermining the votes of the subsidiaries , in any case the vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States C@@ ps , namely the funds of &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; funds , &quot; the Au@@ te@@ os Capital , the International El@@ li@@ sis , International El@@ li@@ ot , and Liverpool &apos;s Liverpool , will not have been achieved by a majority .
the vote would have been 45 % against 37 .
the appeals court is omitted from this information .
from another angle , this was the fault of the difficult situation that it faced from 2008 in the face of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced , with the United States , as it were , from the country .
for the time being , the signature of the González González family will put an interim appeal to the appeals court itself , so that the vote will come to the House &apos;s plenary , that is to say the five magistrates , since only three voted .
it will not succeed in achieving the use of Sardinia , which calls for the review of the process by a higher body , in this case the Supreme Court of Justice in the United States .
what is serious about the court was the fact that a document sent out by the government of Mexico under the Court of Auditors ( &apos; friend of the Court &apos; ) details of the procedure followed by in vitro under the Law of Business competitions , pointing out that it was a breach of the conventions signed by the two countries in order to tie it up to Chapter 15 of the United States &apos; bankruptcies law .
moreover , it is pointed out that the country resigned to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade , that is to say the rules set for cross @-@ border insolvency cases , which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors .

H@@ é@@ tor &quot; H@@ e@@ n &quot; Christmas : &quot; this has been my life . &quot;
a great deal of credit for the H@@ air@@ tor &quot; H@@ e@@ n &quot; Di@@ tor was more than 60 years attached to the sport of the prescription and , thanks to him , travelled the whole world .
few people in Puerto Rico have a mental meal collection in the history of the local bal@@ on@@ that is as broad as the H@@ e@@ tor &quot; H@@ e@@ n &quot; Christmas .
and it is that before an brain spill confined himself to a wheelchair in 2008 , he has been in sport for more than 60 years , being a smaller @-@ category player , a player of the National Bal@@ on@@ this Board , a leader in the B@@ S@@ N , and the leader of the Federation of Bal@@ on@@ ch .
&quot; I put a lot of lip service through my life , including several at the same time , as when he was President of B@@ S@@ N , a general manager of the National Assistance team and President @-@ in @-@ office during the 1990 &quot; s , recalled for a First H@@ ora visit to his home in Bavaria , where he resides with Elizabeth , his faithful wife for more than 50 years .
&quot; it has been my life . &quot;
kings do not exaggerate in doing that .
the walls of his home , almost all of them with photos and memorable taste that give their broad trajectory , testify to this .
Machiavelli at the heart
of all , those who have the greatest emotion are those who remember their passage through the chips from the mid @-@ decade of the 50 as a player until 1982 , when it took 15 years to take over the franchise .
&quot; these were my best years , most of which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight championships of the jeans since 1967 , whether it was as a win @-@ win landing .
it was many years of satisfying action , including the five run @-@ up , from 1971 to 1975 .
and then I did not call on one in the 1981 , the year of the de@@ out of Jersey M@@ in@@ in@@ and in the B@@ S@@ N .
in the past , &quot; a single administrator , &quot; a great manager , &quot; was issued .
I remember G@@ ene Bar@@ to@@ w , who had led here and was at the University of A@@ lab@@ ama ( Birmingham ) , he told me : &apos; I have a strong player , 6 &apos; 7 &apos; of stature .
do you want it ? &quot;
and that was the principle of Mad@@ in@@ y , one of the best players who had Puerto Rico .
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the Franco @-@ sh@@ in@@ ator , who was na@@ vi@@ zed and was one of our best masters .
I remember that he would help to get another if M@@ in@@ in@@ y had given him a Celtic championship .
the Fair Trade championship has been enjoyed by the distance , because by 1988 , it was already in federal hands .
for that time , he preferred to enjoy his records and those of Mad@@ in@@ and in the National Teams .
I remember when we had the United States for the first time during the Baltics in Mexico in 1989 .
then came the World 1990 World , where we came to a quarter , and it should have been to have been crowned not to be by the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final game for the second time , he said .
is the World 1990 group the best member of the National Party ?
he is among the best , as is the one who won the Cha@@ am T@@ EA@@ M in the 2004 Olympics .
but my favorite was that of the Pan @-@ Americans in Cuba in 1991 , when we won gold , and we gave the United States team a bit similar , which was quite similar to that who won the world in the world .
that team not only repeated M@@ in@@ y , Gl@@ on Ri@@ os , Fi@@ o López , and &quot; Piñera &quot; , but also ( Javier ) &quot; Toyota , &quot; Royal Carter , brothers Leon , Francis and Ed@@ ar ) , and Mario &quot; Q@@ j@@ ver &quot; Morales , who had not been able to be in the 1990 &quot; s due to a t@@ dent in the ro@@ ita .
a team that was perhaps not the best in staff , but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the 1995 Olympic Conference in Ne@@ u@@ qu@@ den , Argentina .
with role players like &quot; C@@ an@@ to &quot; Nigel , Paul Aliyev , and a youth Pon@@ ar H@@ uro@@ ru@@ ro@@ er , replacing the players suspended by the mess of the P@@ ata &apos;s mess , we won gold against all forecasts .
what was the best player in Puerto Rico ?
certainly , that has been Piñera Or@@ ti@@ z .
its numbers at international reunion level are impressive .
no one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piñera did .
and that is not counting his record on the different leagues that he played .
who was the best evil leader ?
that is very difficult .
we have had a very good horse which includes July T@@ gold , the F@@ er@@ or Mel@@ eli@@ a , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dal@@ m@@ au , Ar@@ man@@ o Torres .
of young people , I very much like the work of Le@@ o Ari@@ ll .
what are your greatest achievement in the federation ?
it was part of the most glorious era of the National Panel between 1988 and 1995 , and that in the early 1990 &quot; s the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
what was to be done ?
there were things that it would have wanted to implement , such as the regionalisation of the smaller categories .
for example , that the boys of P@@ 11 were only concerned in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in the national players .
now children travel and play too much in unnecessary way .
I can at least see the fruit of compulsion and course for leaders , table officers , and arbiter .
I am pleased about that .
what do you do now ?
the most I do is listening music , seeing videos from the music of my time on YouTube , I enjoy my grandchildren , and from time to ticking games .
of course , I enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .
the actor Larry St@@ man dies
Larry Hag@@ man , born on 21 September 1931 , in For@@ h Bal@@ h ( Texas ) , has become globally famous for his central role like John Ros@@ s Ewing , more known as &quot; D@@ R &quot; television , in the series of &quot; D@@ ol@@ ist &quot; television in which he embodied an unscrupulous , malicious , and manipulated business man .
Larry Hag@@ man , whose role as the oil tycoon J@@ R@@ .@@ Ewing in the series &quot; D@@ ro@@ walls &quot; TV body became a symbol of greed in the 1980 &quot; s , he has died .
he was 81 years old .
Hag@@ man , who returned this year as J.@@ R@@ a , in a new season of &quot; D@@ ol@@ --@@ &quot; died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications , according to a family communiqué provided to The Maghreb Press by the B@@ ag@@ ner Br@@ os , a &quot; D@@ ol@@ ist &quot; house .
&quot; Larry was back in his beloved home city of D@@ ro@@ a , representing once again the non @-@ skilled role that he preferred most , &quot; the family said .
the family of Larry , and his closest friends , were with him in D@@ ro@@ a for the Fair Action Day .
he , bordering on his wife &apos;s role in the original series and in the aftermath , was with Hag@@ man when he died in a D@@ ro@@ a hospital , said the advertisers of her , Jeffrey Lan@@ e .
I was happy to know what he was aware of .
it was creative , generous , amusing , amusing , benevolent and talented , and I will be very surprised .
&quot; he was an original person , and lived to the full , &quot; he stated in a communiqué .
he was diagnosed with liver liver in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a long time for years .
in 1995 , a malignant tumor was found in the liver and it was subjected to a transplant .
years before &quot; D@@ ol@@ as , &quot; Hag@@ man became famous on television as a decent kind in the light @-@ joke of &quot; I Sh@@ am of Sheikh , &quot; disseminated by the N@@ BC chain from 1965 to 1970 .
he interpreted the captain Tony Nelson , an astronau@@ t whose life is disrupted when he finds an attractive genius , interpreted by Barbara E@@ den , and leads him to live with him at his home .
it was also a major player in two restraint that were little time in the air , &quot; The Go@@ y Life &quot; ( N@@ BC , 1971 @-@ 72 ) , and &quot; h@@ ere W@@ e A@@ g@@ in &quot; ( A@@ BC , 1973 ) .
his work on the film in the cinema included roles well received by the criticism in The Group , &quot; Harry and T@@ a &quot; and &quot; First Col@@ ors . &quot;
but he was his master in the interpretation of the lovely infamous J@@ R@@ si , which led it to its peak at its peak .
the dramatic series of the C@@ BS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit went to the air in April 1978 to May 1991 .
the promotion sentence &quot; W@@ ho sh@@ ot J.@@ R@@ a &apos; , designed to generate expectation around an emotional episode in which the H@@ man &apos;s character almost was murdered , led to international speculation and millions of risky dollars in gambling houses .
he also helped to give the number a record at that time .
when the response was revealed in a chapter of November 1980 , an average of 41 million viewers have been skewed and converted to &quot; D@@ y@@ as &quot; in the second most seen entertainment program in history , behind the end of &quot; Mas@@ h &quot; in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
it was the G@@ ñ@@ u of J@@ R@@ a , K@@ en@@ n ( interpreted by Mary C@@ n@@ by ) who shot it out .
J@@ R@@ a , and then threatened to dismiss it as a prostitute unless it was outside the city , but others also had reason to attack it .
Hag@@ man interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile : a clever businessman and an un@@ faithful husband who tried that his alcoholic wife , Su@@ r E@@ len ( Lin@@ da Graz ) , were to take place .
&quot; I know what I want on the call for J@@ R , &quot; he said in 1988 .
I should like to say : &apos; here lies the honest citizen , J@@ si Ewing &apos; .
this is the only negotiation that he lost .
the editor @-@ in @-@ office of the original series of victory in the original series was that Friday was a &quot; enormous , inside and out of the screen &quot; victory .
it is intractable , irreplaceable , for millions of fans in the world , and in the hearts of every one of us , that we were lucky enough to know and love it .
ten episodes in the new &quot; D@@ ol@@ ist &quot; edition were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the N@@ T channel .
the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth in the process had already been completed , the chain reported .
immediately , there was no statement from War@@ ner or N@@ T on how to deal with the loss of Hag@@ man .
in the eyes of Fu@@ an@@ h , Texas , it was the son of the ac@@ z , Mary Martin , who ran classical works like &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; Peter P@@ an . &quot;
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage with the lawyer Ben He@@ man .
he proved lucky in New York &apos;s theatre scenarios at the beginning of the 1950 &apos;s , and then served in the Air Force in 1952 to 1956 in England .
while he was there , Sweden &apos;s young design has been met .
the couple had two children , Pro@@ st@@ on , and Pennsylvania , and lived for a long time in the California city of Mali , where many celebrities live .
in 2001 , he called his memoirs &quot; H@@ so Dar@@ lin &quot; : T@@ all ( and Ab@@ bullet and Truth ) T@@ es M@@ y Life . &quot;
&quot; I did not believe that I would think that it would be a pity , or in any case affect someone , &quot; said to the press that it was associated at the time .
after liver transplantation , he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a voluntary in a hospital to attend fearful patients .
&quot; I advise them , I give them courage , I meet them when they come for their rugby , and then , &quot; he indicated in 1996 .
to try to provide some consolation , as &quot; no fear , will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but they are going to be good . &quot;
he was also an activist against smoking and took part in several campaigns .
pursuing the World \ u0027s &quot; F@@ in the World &quot;
every week , students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war , zombie , viruses , and triggers , and global warming .
this six @-@ month period , when the Catholic professor and religion decided to hold a course on the world , he knew that he had an irresistible win : the end of the &quot; long @-@ run &quot; of Cal@@ end@@ ary M@@ aya , on December 21 , to which many people have stuck as a test of the end of the world .
but Ch@@ arm@@ é had no idea what he had expected of him in the next couple of months : the caricature hurricane Sandy , a fiscal cliff that some have called &quot; the debtor to &quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel , the place where Christian theorists of the end of the times believe that the A@@ dot will begin .
&quot; I did not realise that this was going to be the most apocalyptic six @-@ month period , &quot; he said this week to students at the Ru@@ t@@ ers @-@ Cam@@ den University ( New Jersey ) students .
if you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting , this was a really good period .
and remember that it is bad for those of apocalyptic mentality .
and he is not only a professor who offers courses on the &quot; end of the world &quot; this six @-@ month , theoretically the last of the story .
in the storm , the deputy professor , Mr Bartenstein , is not carrying out the course of the &quot; media , culture , and the end of the world . &quot;
every week , students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war , zombie , viruses , and triggers , and global warming .
&quot; we look at why these ideas are proliferating over time , &quot; he said , and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide some human behavior .
if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , there could be a war .
this month students discussed films with apocalyptic issues and explored how they compare with examples of real life .
&quot; I tried to inform students about what is possible , likely , credible and impossible , &quot; said Tuberculosis .
in Latin America &apos;s central University of Pennsylvania professor , the Latin American professor of history in Latin America and his colleague A@@ ö@@ Sol@@ ari , a deputy professor of history of the Ar@@ te and anthropo@@ ology , have done equipment to provide a course , entitled only &quot; The end of the world . &quot;
&quot; we do not add to 2012 &apos; to always have the option of giving the new course , if the world does not finish , &apos; he said .
despite the &quot; imminent ruin , &quot; students must study , generate projects , and take final examinations .
in Pennsylvania , the final test will be taken on the eve of the CBR , which leaves students more than working &quot; until the very night that the world is supposed to end , &quot; he said .
the courses were quite popular .
&quot; there was a two @-@ hour height , &quot; he said , on his course for high @-@ average students , which was filled with 35 students .
we received e @-@ mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the six @-@ month period of people who asked whether there was yet room .
students , for their part , claim that the course is one of the most interesting .
&quot; I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to make comfort in themselves , &quot; said Brid@@ g@@ id Robinson , a student of the 23 @-@ year @-@ old club of HADEP , New Jersey , in Ru@@ t@@ ers @-@ Cam@@ den .
and it is that the apocalyptic , secular , or religious mindset is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it .
it will be a student of the 25 @-@ year @-@ old career in P@@ is@@ logy and Pro@@ d@@ lia , who said that he has seen all of the apocalyptic films .
&quot; he had never heard about a class that could teach that , &quot; he indicated .
I enjoy it .
but no student interviewed - and much less a professor - said at the sell @-@ out date of 21 December .
&quot; our first project dealt with self @-@ fulfilling prophecy , and in a certain way will discredit it , &quot; said Ju@@ lie Z@@ eg@@ en , a last year &apos;s student in a 21 @-@ year @-@ old student and West Ch@@ ester .
the elderly never predicted the world &apos;s end ; it is just a key point in the timetable , he said .
but he neglected an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture , dating back to centuries , in which people react to changes around the world .
the Internet has caused a boom in these speculation .
&quot; elsewhere , people do not think about it , &quot; he said .
mostly in the English @-@ speaking world .
Joseph Sil@@ er@@ ty , a religion professor at the University La Sal@@ le , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about some course on the &quot; end of the world &quot; there .
&quot; the Philippines does not participate in the end of the world , &quot; he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher authority .
we have a pardon from the Pope .
it has noted that , over the years , there have been many days of the final judgment , and said that , if nothing happens on 21 December , &quot; people will start thinking immediately on the next date , &quot; or philosopher , that 21 December is the start of a seven @-@ year period from which the world will end .
students and teachers are taking the date lightly .
a number of people said that they think they are going to be in order &apos; of the end of the world &apos; .
&quot; perhaps he will call some friends to get together , &quot; commented Ford , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old communications student .
