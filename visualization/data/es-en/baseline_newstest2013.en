a Republican Strategy to obstruct Obama &apos;s re @-@ election
the Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud .
however , the Brenner Centre regards this as a myth , and says that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray .
indeed , Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation .
in this sense , these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system .
contrary to what is happening in Canada , the American states are responsible for the organisation of the federal elections in the United States .
and , on the same line , a majority of American governments , from 2009 , issued new laws that made it difficult to register or vote .
this phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections , which saw the rise of 6@@ 75 new Republican representatives in 26 states .
as a result , in 2011 , 180 law projects were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states .
the new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photograph , as well as a test of American citizenship .
on the other hand , these laws reduce the pre @-@ voting periods , invalidate the right to register as a constituent on the day of scrutiny , and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal records .
before the 2006 elections , no American state required the voters to produce an identity card with photograph .
the Advocate state was the first to demand it .
the United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Supreme Court .
that is why the Republican authorities rushed to extend that practice to other states .
in recent years , these authorities have supported legislative projects in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with photograph .
it is important to bear in mind that , contrary to Qu@@ é@@ ec , American citizens do not have a universal identity card , such as the Social Security card .
in fact , 11 % of American citizens , that is , 21 million people of voting age , do not have any identity cards with a photograph issued by a government agency of their state .
on the other hand , five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity card with such characteristics .
but , often , obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars .
as a result , the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people , minorities and low @-@ income people .
indeed , 25 % African @-@ Americans , 15 % of people earning less than $ 35 per year , 18 % of citizens aged over 65 and 20 % of voters aged 18 @-@ 29 do not have a photo identity card .
there is still more .
in many states , students , voters who vote most to the Democratic candidates , cannot use the identity card with photograph issued by their institution .
on the other hand , these same states authorise members of fishing or hunting clubs that usually vote to Republican parties to use the documents issued by these clubs .
before 2004 , no state was required for the citizens to vote .
the first state was the first to present such a demand .
since 2011 , a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to show that they are American citizens .
these measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote .
it seems that two out of three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party .
on the other hand , Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished voters &quot; registration on the same day of scrutiny in eight states .
in addition , they restricted the right of individuals and groups to create a aid service to voters who would like to register .
these restrictions have consequences .
for example , in the 2004 general election , voters &quot; registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens .
the measures that have been taken since 2009 managed to get the registration rate for new voters to fall in 2010 by comparison with 2006 .
moreover , Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction in the voting period in advance .
for example , in the 2008 elections in Florida , 33 % of voters who voted in advance were African @-@ Americans , while the latter accounted for more than 13 % of the state &apos;s voters .
in the case of Guinea , exactly the same thing happened .
they represent only 11 % of the electorate , which is equivalent to 24 % of the citizens voting in advance .
however , whites , which represent 76 % of the electorate , represent no more than 46 % of the citizens voting in advance .
of course , the Democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voters &quot; registration .
in this sense , the Democratic governors have blocked several draft laws .
the US prosecutor &apos;s ministry intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
it was , in part , possible to limit the damage .
for example , only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law that required the presentation of an identity card with photograph .
however , it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012 .
critics of Democrats denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on , as it is clear that they aim to influence the results of 2012 in key states .
a report from the Railway Centre for 2011 shows that states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the necessary 270 votes in the electoral college in order to achieve the presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at an electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation .
in this respect , the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system .
the screening of prostate cancer : is it the test or not doing it ?
the P@@ SA test , in fact , sometimes presents incorrect results , with false negative results , or even false positive results , after which pointless medical interventions are decided .
that is one more reason than enough to make the men , who are already reluctant , doubt whether or not the screening tests should be carried out .
is it the test or not ?
we have asked for advice from two specialists .
in the studies carried out in the United States , a large rate of infection among the groups of evidence has been identified , so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations .
for their part , the European study showed a certain difference in mortality among patients that had been tested and not .
the study , with a follow @-@ up to 12 years , showed , moreover , that there is 30 @-@ 40 % potential for injury if the detection test has not been carried out .
I recommend , therefore , the test of 50 years , or from 40 years &apos; time if your father has experienced prostate cancer .
the American @-@ American men of origin have a higher risk index .
the key is to take a good decision once cancer has been detected .
there are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are lazy .
it is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his cancer , must be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not discriminate against life in the long term , in which case we must choose more for active monitoring of the disease .
today , many men who have been detected in cancer are not treated , as that cancer is neither aggressive nor poses a risk to their lives .
instead , we suggest active monitoring of the disease and , if it is progressing , we offer them a deal .
we are increasingly aware of precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated .
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case .
but it is important that you speak to your doctor in order to determine whether the test should be made or not .
the International Drug Society has been created , in collaboration with the International Society of Ur@@ ology , a tool that makes it possible to assess the pros and cons of the P@@ SA test .
this document can be discharged ( at the moment only in English , but translations will soon be offered ) in the next direction : 4 : / / c@@ .@@ mo@@ ve@@ .com / FR / is @-@ heed .
preventing Disease
unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer .
despite the progress of research , the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering the disease .
we believe that if everyone in the world was able to do it properly and worked well enough , 30 % of the cancers could be prevented .
&quot; if no one smoking , that rate would be raised , at least , to 50 % , &quot; underlines André nic@@ li@@ or@@ ent , the People &apos;s Society spokesman against Cancer .
instead , we estimate that around 10 % of cancers are hereditary .
many others are still totally inexplicable .
the fight against cancer is still a priority for the Can@@ di@@ ate Society against Cancer , despite the reduction in the number of smokers .
tobacco is linked to 85 % of cases of lung cancer .
it is also a risk factor for other types of cancers .
it greatly affects people &apos;s health .
&quot; today , there are still 1.5 million smokers in Qaddafi , &quot; declared spokesperson for the spokesman .
a hopeful fact : 10 years after leaving smoking , the risk of dying of cancer is halved .
the Im@@ weight
disease and obesity also encourage the emergence of the disease , according to SCAF .
they increase the risks of breast @-@ cancer , sp@@ ar , and r@@ ar cancer , of tu@@ ge@@ e , of p@@ ag@@ as , and u@@ u@@ ge@@ as .
&quot; research shows that the regular practice of physical activity during life protects against breast cancer , &quot; add .
food
the body also recommends limiting the use of red meat .
in large quantities , they raise the risks of suffering a sober cancer .
chat products must also be avoided .
the preservation of meat for its eaten , dried or emotional meat can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances .
&quot; they can damage the body &apos;s cells and lead to cancer development , &quot; they explain .
vitamins
in recent years , several scientists have studied the links between vitamin and cancer complex .
at the moment , however , their investigations are not conclusive .
in the eyes of the SCAF , the studies on vitamin E are contradictory .
while one of them found a drop in the risk of prostate cancer , in another that was observed , it was , rather , an increase .
the effect of vitamin D in cancer has not been made clear either .
, on the other hand , M. Go@@ li@@ af insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family background of each with his doctor .
&quot; making the screening test does not cause cancer . &quot;
the Com@@ ion of For@@ ings in detail
the likely discovery of the For@@ ion Bosnian River generated a great deal of shock last summer , and rightly so .
it is indeed the case that this forest is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe , nothing more and nothing less .
what is more , the particle that predicted the standard model : our best or less bad &quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of the subject , which has not yet been empirical .
but for physicists , it is not entirely clear that they should be counted .
we know , of course , that there is a new particle , and that there is a great deal to be found of the whistle @-@ blowers predicted by the standard model .
moreover , new data revealed this week at a major Kyoto congress congress seem to confirm that it is , although there is still a lack of more data to be completely safe .
all the same , we assume that they are the headlines , because the chances of the mistakes are few , and we shall see what this is about .
there is a general and unavoidable law in this great world which means that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time .
there is no way to infringe that rule and not try too much , because it will end up doing harm .
although particle physics is a very complex world , it has been demonstrated that there is such a law as well : the principle of exclusion from P@@ li , which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time as they are in the same &quot; quantum state &quot; ; a &quot; state &quot; that is , in any way , of some of its characteristics .
physicists classify particles in two categories .
on the one hand , we are faced with the good citizens so @-@ called TV citizens , who rightly obey the principle of P@@ li .
and , on the other hand , there are the Serbs , a dirty bunch of asteroid who have no respect for anything , or at least not for this principle , which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time .
according to the The Human Workers &quot; website The Human Workers &quot; website , which , by the way , is extraordinary , Bosnian groups are divided into two groups : the arrows , of which we will not be talking here , and the &quot; particles of force , &quot; whereby the great forces of nature spread , and with which the headlines would be in some connection .
these Bosnians , you should stress here , are not the exotic bi@@ an@@ ity that we could believe .
indeed , if he manages to read this chronic , it is thanks to an extraordinarily trivial Bosnian village : the Titanic , or the &quot; light particle &quot; acting as the &quot; messenger &quot; of electromagnetic force .
indeed , when a particle with an electric burden accelerates or changes direction , &quot; de@@ orders &quot; electromagnetic field ethics in that precise environment ; a little like when we throw a stone into a quagmire .
in this &quot; disorder , &quot; an electromagnetic wave is born - in the light , of the under@@ run , of ultra @-@ star , etc . - and this wave is nothing other than a photo ; in other words , one of the &quot; operators of force . &quot;
more stable
the same is true of the headscarf , with the difference that this is the other field , the camp of For@@ gs , which needs to be &quot; disorderly &quot; to be found to be found to be found .
there is a lot more stability than the electromagnetic field , but in order to activate it , we need to reach an extremely high level of energy , a bit as if it were a quagmire in which only a rock rock could fall into the surface .
that is why there is a need for a huge particles of particles such as that of CER@@ N ( the big h@@ der of the ni@@ der is a ring of 27 km of algae ! ) in order to achieve these levels of energy .
the analogy with electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between whistle and mass .
in fact , not all particles and all materials interact with electromagnetic fields .
some , like magnets , do so , but others do not : a piece of paper , for example , will never stand up for itself at the door of a snow@@ age .
and , in the same way , not all particles interact with the field of whistle @-@ blowers : those who do so have a mass , while the rest ( how the photo , incidentally ) , do not .
but what can you do &apos; all of these investigations ? .
for science , this serves to verify the validity of the standard model ( MS ) , and also allows the screening of the differences between the CRS &apos;s observations and predictions .
for their part , many very strongly want to find themselves , for the lesser difference could open a door to a &quot; new physics &quot; that plug certain holes in the model .
this , it has to be said , still has enormous shortcomings , as it does not propose any of the severity of the gravity ( by and from the dark matter , which accounts for around 80 % of the university &apos;s matter ( and another . ) .
however , we have not found such differences in CER@@ N so far .
consequences
the impact of such research on our day is difficult to predict , but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will have none .
to see : at the beginning of the 1960 &quot; s , the pioneers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their jobs would lead to .
they saw scientific applications , but nothing else .
in fact , as the physicist Wil@@ ard Bo@@ yle , who worked in the Bel@@ l laboratories , who worked in the 1960s , and who drew up the first test in 1962 , in 1962 , at the beginning , it was rather regarded as a &quot; laboratory machine . &quot;
imagine ...
and furthermore , applications can also come from all the equipping of research .
for example , the same Wil@@ ard Bo@@ sey himself drew up a 1969 spotlight in the course of his research on optical grounds .
despite the fact that it was not at all its original intention , this radar now serves as a &quot; eye &quot; for all digital equipment in the world , which was won by the physics Nobel in 2009 .
that does not mean , of course , that the L@@ H@@ C activities necessarily want to transform our lives , but that it is never known ...
the best way to die - the best way to die ...
in its Commission , Mor@@ r in dignity , Qu@@ é@@ ec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life .
the debate must be resumed soon as a draft law is being prepared .
now , within that essential dominance , there is still a great deal to be done .
you have tried to see you closely .
just a few weeks ago , Mr L@@ .@@ lived only in her apartment of the Mon@@ ore .
prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breathing space of two years .
&quot; I had been given five years of life , but I have already had seven years of life , &quot; to speak , a shift , lying on his bed in the Bel@@ o @-@ G@@ c@@ is of Bel@@ o @-@ care center , to which he arrived the previous day .
&quot; but it is always a shock , we cannot be ready for this , &quot; it continues .
the disease has caused it havoc : a huge weakness that prevents it from going only to bathing , and even eating on its own .
faced with a charm lunch , he accepts resigned that he will help him to eat .
brave , even to smile , to talk to the unknown to him , brings them medicines , and offer him a bathing .
the courage of ordinary death .
&quot; my greatest wish is that I cure the diarrhea , it is humiliating , &quot; he trust .
a few hours later , the team found a remedy to that evil .
&quot; in the course of our lives , we learn that a man is making the right to the ground , &quot; quotes Pierre Bro@@ de@@ ur , a psychologist at the center Victor @-@ G@@ w@@ is .
returning to children , for certain people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
&quot; that depends on the person &apos;s ability to accept that regression , &quot; he notes .
because , according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care , the great times are taking place at the very heart of this regression .
all patients who come into the the center care center Victor @-@ G@@ w@@ is suffer from cancer .
they have a three @-@ month maximum life forecast .
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide &quot; cure . &quot;
the greatest fear of Mrs A. , of 89 years , is to die &apos; conscious and drowning &apos; .
but the disease has shown him to discover his children .
&quot; I have good children , &quot; he adds .
&quot; I have no more desire for you in this life , &quot; you say , before you accept that you have a charity to help you breathe .
and he expects , in the next few days , a last visit of his son who lives in Italy .
in Victor @-@ G@@ N , there is a group of volunteers , body care and food aid .
they are palliative care that they are given when nothing else can be done .
in order to help their death to be more comfortable .
in Qu@@ é@@ ec we have a palliative care bed for every 11.@@ 700 inhabitants .
it is very little , as we know that everyone will end up dying one day .
here , life is still in the best possible conditions , explains the D@@ ang@@ - Ros@@ o Mar@@ u@@ el , one of the centre &apos;s school@@ teachers .
whether it is physical , emotional or spiritual comfort .
the dying is being offered to heart is to be painted with p@@ dy or P@@ ep@@ si , according to demand .
children are no longer controlled by their sugar rate .
death is part of the day .
last night we served Mr X , who died in the course of the night .
this morning , his son ended beer in the feet of the late .
&quot; we helped both patients and their loved ones , &quot; raise N@@ at@@ ali@@ e Sav@@ ard , the manager of the care .
at center Victor @-@ G@@ bo@@ a days , it goes without ever being the same .
on the side of a 94 @-@ year @-@ old man who knows his last family meeting in the yard , well placed among his al@@ od@@ o as he is wearing his health , a 36 @-@ year @-@ old man dies tragically , surrounded by his parents , his wife , and his two children , having tried everything to survive .
&quot; for six months , there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 . &quot;
53 % of patients who are admitted to centre Victor @-@ G@@ w@@ is@@ ir will come from their house and 47 % of the hospital .
problem of access to palliative care
77 % of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care , that is to say care designed to relieve suffering when a sick arrives at the terminal stage of his life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care centre .
and a number of bodies , such as center Victor @-@ G@@ bo@@ is , and the home @-@ Mon@@ er @-@ care @-@ keeping society , specialise almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients .
it is precisely this great lack of health care in Q@@ é@@ ec &apos;s health care that makes many doctors specialised in palliative care fear of the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and attended suicide .
since October , a manifesto signed by a chorus of palliative care , such as Dr Bal@@ l@@ ur Min@@ t and Dr Bernard L@@ ad@@ te , are circulating in order to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
according to Dor@@ o Mar@@ ain Mar@@ el , Q@@ d@@ ec &apos;s health system is not sufficiently competent to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted on euthanasia .
&quot; recently , &quot; referred , &quot; I have seen a patient spend 14 days as a patient suffering great pain without having done what is necessary to alleviate it .
I fear that patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate care . &quot;
and , in parallel , many onco@@ logists persist with their patients up to the last day , despite the worst forecasts .
Hélène Richard Richard &apos;s hopes for survival were already low when he left the treatment of exhausting chemotherapy .
&apos;@@ When I told her to me to stop the treatment , she told me that he had a great deal to do I would like to stop fighting &apos; , to talk .
&quot; I had said , however , that there was nothing more to do ! &quot;
there is no powerful care
the D@@ ra@@ . Mar@@ os thinks that 90 % of the sick people who ask for dying would be grateful for their carers who have not listened to them in their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team .
but it has to be said that palliative care is not absolutely all @-@ powerful when it comes to the treatment of pain .
according to El@@ si@@ e Mon@@ er@@ au , the director of the home @-@ to @-@ tongue palliative care @-@ in @-@ house , patients do not respond to pain by 8 % of cases .
at the end of life , doctors tend to resort to palliative waste , which serves to sleep for the patient until the moment of death , whether in a sporadic or permanent form .
we cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering .
increasingly , the un@@ relieved disease is going to have the chance to have such a palliative disease .
the sick people who are not relieved say the same thing : &apos; I want to die &apos; .
but that does not necessarily mean &quot; I want euthanasia , &quot; but &quot; I want to be relieved . &quot;
the implementation of this report has been made possible by a journalism grant from Canada &apos;s health research institutes .
large @-@ scale housing stocks in Qu@@ é@@ ec
officials of the B@@ TP , the employers of the B@@ TP , the senior politicians and specialists of the Italian mafia know , day after day , what they know of a formidable &quot; system &quot; of , of which the construction industry , civil servants , politicians , trade unionists and mafia are part .
a &quot; industry &quot; that went too expensive for the taxpayers to eat , especially in the 1990 &quot; s and 2000 years .
&quot; it is curious how the system is being filtered through once we have fallen to the big media , &quot; im@@ on@@ za Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au , a Member in Qu@@ é@@ ec , and a former police head of Montreal .
he led to the outbreak of the scandal in 2011 , which was made possible by an in @-@ depth investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Q@@ é@@ ec , that the moment &apos;s liberal prime minister , Jean Ro@@ est , had no sense in delaying .
the &quot; Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report &quot; established a direct link between industry , the clandestine financing of parties , and corruption among officials .
&quot; since the beginning of research in 2010 , only the transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars in contracts , &quot; containing some of their instincts to stay with a proportional share .
the Commission has already fallen to two mayors , &quot; adds , &quot; while waiting to &quot; demonstrate the existing tactics behind individuals . &quot;
a permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , created in 2011 ,
the permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , created in 2011 , also applies to its team of auditors , researchers , and government analysts .
this unit works as well as the police of &apos; the hiding Mar@@ au au &apos; , which , since 2009 , has made the &apos; sewage cartel &apos; in Montreal moderate when it comes to raising contracts .
the last few weeks , unity has carried out the register in a number of charges for fraud and corruption against municipal offices such as Frank Z@@ ol@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ d@@ te , Mayor of a town on the outskirts .
the next list would be Gilani &apos;s V@@ ai@@ a court , which has just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval , a third city of Q@@ é@@ ec .
there is a suspicion that there has been repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts .
it has been formally charged to engineers in the road network in Montreal and to Italian people of origin , such as Tony Action and L@@ ino Zīle .
the latter has caused shock by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the &apos; system of public contracts &apos; .
he himself paid for three years by 3 % of the value of the contracts made in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia that transferred money to the mafia , the party of the Mayor of the Mayor of the Mayor of Turkey .
Mr Zīle , in the years 2000 , set money out of money for the years 2000 , giving more than 8@@ 8,000 Canadian dollars ( around EUR 6@@ 8,000 ) to provincial parties , especially the liberals in power .
he also admitted that he had organised a collection of illegal funds for the former deputy @-@ Deputy Liberal minister , N@@ ai@@ ali@@ e Mar@@ an@@ de@@ au .
inflation in the cost of sewage contracts
in Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; of corruption worked effectively .
the committee has explained that to the pre @-@ waiting , the former engineer of public works , that in ten years &apos; time , you have received gifts , invitations to travel , golf rooms , restaurants , swimming parties and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $ 7@@ 3@@ 6,000 , all in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs were inflated .
other road @-@ network officials have admitted that they received money for pumping invoices between 30 % and 40 % in the form of a counterfeit extra .
in addition , an organization of the mayor &apos;s party , Martin Duhamel , accused M. Tr@@ ac@@ la@@ a and had deliberately turned a parallel budget to a parallel budget and filled his coffers for dirty money .
as a result of these revelations , M. Tr@@ ag@@ la@@ a resigned at the beginning of November and brought Montreal to a huge crisis .
Do@@ el Rouhani was one of the first Montreal policies of Montreal sounding the alarm .
in the east of the island , the district of Ri@@ vi@@ er@@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ des @-@ P@@ wisdom has been opposed to the sale of a municipal area acquired by USD 5 million , which was picked up by 1.6 million for promoters in a real estate boom .
70 % of money for election campaigns was dirty money
from the research that will eventually be carried out , she ensures that he gets a balance in order to understand the operation of the system , infiltrated by g@@ mi@@ en@@ ic , in order to stop the man@@ am@@ ine and fish the guilty parties . &apos;
and it adds that the process is &quot; painful but positive . &quot;
we are cleaning up the wounds , but we would need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very vigilant in order to ensure that dubious practices are not repeated .
how to clean up .
regularly .
Mr Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au , for his part , declares that &quot; officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars , &quot; but he is worried , above all , about the role of &apos; elected politicians &apos; .
a 70 % share of dirty money that was allocated to the financing of election campaigns in Qu@@ é@@ ec , a pity : &quot; I have been told that this is nothing more than a weak reflection of reality . &quot;
e @-@ governance proposes to limit donations to parties to $ 100 , but that will not change the donation , according to him , &quot; as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
it advocates a complete review of the system for awarding public contracts and funding of parties : &apos; we cannot fall lower ; going to the bottom of things , with courage , will enable us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation , with more controls and laws &apos; .
if this story masks the international image of Q@@ é@@ ec and Montreal , M. Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au invites those who would take a look in the mirror .
&quot; It is not the P@@ G that is the Barcelona QE ! &quot;
this season has acquired a new entity with the PS@@ G .
how would you explain that progress ?
it could be explained by an individual conscience , but also by the new G @-@ G dimension .
big players have come .
let us take day @-@ to @-@ day day .
the technical staff have also contributed a great deal .
and these elements encourage me to raise the level of my game every day .
in one party , that is easier .
everything is going very fast in football .
but I am not quiet .
from my beginning at the pre @-@ training centre of IN@@ F C@@ ai@@ rem@@ re@@ en@@ res@@ it@@ im to my turn by Saint @-@ E@@ ti@@ ne , I have always made a quantum leap .
it is going to obtain the benefit of the competition recruited by Mr Carlo An@@ tri@@ otti .
this summer &apos;s recruits are accustomed to disputed high @-@ level parties .
they know that each training is crucial .
that makes a player like me wanting to fight and take everything .
I would also like to say a great deal about my position on Mr Carlo An@@ ch@@ lia .
he is backed up as Claude Ma@@ k@@ el@@ le , who played in the same position as I did .
is the man in need of the team ?
of course .
, for all the technicians , we respect all the technicians .
today , there is no one equal to League 1 and is among the best European coaches .
he has a great deal of experience and has earned many titles with the best clubs .
he has worked with great players .
I believe that other titles will be taken in Paris .
I had a very reassuring conversation with him in January .
I had just come out of a series of injuries .
the confidence you have in me also explains my good return .
what does he think about the G at the first part of the season ?
in League 1 , Lyon has removed the leader &apos;s post .
but we are still in the lurch .
one of our most important objectives is the League of champions : we have been classified for the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ end @-@ in @-@ the @-@ eye .
what is the idea of the club in this competition ?
we will try to get as far as possible .
from now on , it can go through anything .
but we have much to say in the face of many very good European teams .
we want , at the outset , to complete the first of our league in front of the port , so that we can get the return of final phrases .
can the P@@ G can become a large short @-@ term European club ?
it already has the budget ...
to become a large European club , Paris has to earn titles and is there in the long term .
that is not the case today .
at the economic level , the P@@ G is handed over to its means to ensure that this project is put into practice .
do not win the glass in League 1 , as at the last season , would it be a great failure ?
that would , of course , be a great disappointment .
this year we are going to invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champions .
we did not go far enough in the last season .
in May , we were disappointed , as we had the best conditions to finish .
we had a strong season .
we ended up with 79 points .
normally , with 79 points we should have been champions ...
but another team , the Sw@@ al@@ er , had a rather better season .
this year I think it will be the good .
even if the big teams such as Marseilles , Lyon and Bur@@ u@@ en@@ is are fighting for the title , I think we have the weapons to bring that .
do you think that the media expect more from the PS@@ G ?
it is normal for us to expect a lot from us if we think of what has been invested in the players we have .
we have accepted that completely .
after we won 4 @-@ 0 at home in Trojan , who are still in a position to reproach us , it is a little frustrating .
we wonder what more people expect .
we will never be able to win 4 @-@ 0 all the weekend .
we are not the Barcelona QE !
we are trying to put a project in place .
a team is built on time .
we have shown in the champions League that we can respond and be present .
look at Manchester City , which , after two seasons , has not managed to qualify for the final leaflets , and they have also invested a great deal !
in view of the sums invested , we would imagine 15 points of advantage for the day .
that would be to neglect our adversaries and the championship in France .
that the previous season was &quot; driven &quot; by this new P@@ G has been seen by and Marseilles and Marseilles .
that shows that the League is exciting .
I hope that in May , we will be able to say with a smile that , despite all the difficulties , we have ended up with the trophy .
the P@@ G seems to be entirely dependent on the successes of Z@@ in i@@ la@@ in@@ ac .
better than say that we have a &apos; Z@@ en@@ an@@ dependency &apos; .
this means that it is very competent and that it puts many goals in place .
he has come to show that he is the League &apos;s star star .
and he has shown in all the teams that he has gone through a big player , a global star .
in the group , we respect man and the player .
and he also respects the men around him .
what he has done is truly exceptional .
that is pushing others to increase their level of gambling .
Mr Silva , one of the best supporters of the world , also allows us to make progress .
how did the Euro 2012 live with the French team ?
it was a disappointment .
he was very enthusiastic about participating in this Euro@@ glass .
unfortunately , my injury prevented me from accumulating speaking time .
I saw things there and left stronger .
today we are achieving good parties in the selection .
that is what I had hoped for from mine with the &quot; le@@ us . &quot;
we learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine , and that is why we must have exemplary behaviour today .
what vision do you have from the first month of D@@ od@@ er De@@ ck at the head of the &quot; le@@ us &quot; ?
they are achieving results .
they are well placed in the World Cup classification group .
the selection is rigorous , close to the players , and inspires to be won .
this was the case of Laurent Blanc .
but I do not want to make comparisons .
he managed to fit in with his objective of classifying us for the Euro@@ glass .
I hope it will lead to the selection of Brazil .
the 1 @-@ 1 point of 16 October in Spain served to lay the foundations ?
that game gave us confidence .
everyone fought for it .
before that shock in Spain , there had been no similar game in my career .
with B@@ it@@ co@@ in , paying and selling without banks
the opposite is true of the current currency trade based on central banks , the transactions identified and the burden of processing between the parties .
moreover , as is often the case in technologies , the political vision is palpable : the conviction that the current monetary system , consisting of bank monopolies , leads to financial crises .
in fact , B@@ it@@ co@@ in , invented by S@@ u@@ hi N@@ ak@@ am@@ b ( a pseudo name ) , is both a virtual convertible currency to dollars , euros , etc . , and a safe @-@ change protocol to the form of B@@ it@@ it@@ ent , which allows for the exchange of equal files .
nearly 200 000 transactions have been entered into through 15 000 computers on the net .
and around a thousand websites will accept the can@@ ins as donations , or as a means of payment .
the index of B@@ co@@ in , having reached the top of $ 30 ( EUR 23 ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars a few months later , before returning today to around ten dollars ( the contributions are registered on the Cor@@ ri@@ in@@ ch@@ ar@@ com page ) .
it is not impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or in financial products .
however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) was interested in a report on virtual coins published in October .
in it , B@@ co@@ in is described as &quot; the most successful virtual currency , &quot; &quot; competing with the dollar or the euro , &quot; and &quot; similar to conventional currencies . &quot;
Ber@@ co@@ in differs from other virtual currency systems such as &quot; loans , &quot; used to make progress on a needle @-@ game , and that you can win or buy or buy ( and even sometimes buy ) .
the Facebook social network also developed this type of system .
but , in any exchange , a central authority is controlling and changing .
with B@@ co@@ in , all of the two nets are at the same time collecting books , verified books , issuers of currency and buyers and sellers .
how does that network work ?
each transaction between two users is actually between two e @-@ mails in the form of e @-@ mail .
a user can choose a different direction for each payment , thereby guaranteeing anonymity .
a range of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double @-@ key collection system .
the network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction .
thanks to the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the changes in Ci@@ ins are recorded in the public accounts book , which is disseminated throughout the network .
the key milestone is to write that new compromise in that book .
this passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner , a kind of provisional central banker , will have the privilege of adding that complementary line .
this is a phase @-@ in @-@ file phase , that is to say , the transformation of a big file into a shorter , shorter numerical footprint .
computers &quot; co@@ gene &quot; the new compromise and add a number before &quot; cut &quot; the whole .
the aim is to find the number which will offer a particular footprint ( the larger ones at the beginning ) .
once that number is found , the others easily verify that it is the good .
the compromise is then un@@ destructive in the whole chain of other transactions ; any change would change the footprint .
if , in order to commit a fraud , a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly ( in less than ten minutes ) , the network would only accept one of the two transactions ; the other would be orphaned , because they both have different fingerprints .
the computer that solves the challenge is 50 o@@ ins .
to avoid inflation , that reward is divided into two regularly , with probability before the end of 2012 .
the number of go@@ ins in circulation is , therefore , limited to 21 million , but it is visible in the form of an extensive margin , but it leaves a large margin .
the difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in the calculation power .
the life of the network already has its ups and downs .
websites providing services for B@@ it@@ co@@ in have been attacked and go@@ ins in store have been stolen .
&quot; the error used does not affect the same protocol , &quot; guaranteeing Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , which has just launched C@@ ach@@ um , a real @-@ currency payment company that uses the B@@ it@@ co@@ in network .
in addition , the ECB is taking account of the possibilities for the net creation of money thanks to this anonymous service .
but cash in cash presents the same flaw .
powerful players like WikiLeaks reject payments of this kind .
others , like the London platform , accept them .
recently , A@@ di S@@ ham@@ ir and D@@ ori@@ t R@@ on , of the In@@ row of We@@ iz@@ mann in Israel , looked at the accounting book and showed that nearly 80 % of go@@ ins are not circulating .
in November , &quot; giants &quot; were launched .
&quot; we have changed $ 30 000 , &quot; there is a joy in the Hol@@ th@@ st , who works for Co@@ in@@ in@@ it@@ um , which turns the co@@ ins into gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , the author of a teaching book on that currency , believes in the potential of this technology as well as on the transaction network .
its system , C@@ rem@@ t@@ ia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real currency ) or a mobile @-@ mobile payment , but uses B@@ it@@ co@@ in to validate transactions , which make it cheaper .
the bearer , moreover , manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous .
the system is easy to put in place in the shops , which do not have to install new terminals or goats .
it is enough to provide a way that a telephone can &quot; paint and recognize , &quot; accurately Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , which ensures that thousands of users are to be made available .
there is a general move to revise the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems .
&quot; it will take a time for B@@ it@@ co@@ in to be imposed , but , in 2013 , there could be a change , &quot; it predicts .
on the other hand , in its report , the ECB provides for a number of different risks to be raised , and today it is considered high if this currency is to succeed .
we have left Afghanistan .
and then ?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan ( K@@ ro@@ sa and S@@ bi ) .
NATO and Americans must go out at the end of 2014 .
it is time for the Afghan army to return to its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future , without expecting anything from us .
we have been punished in particular for the Afghan farmers , who have been considered terrorists .
and we ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , more injured and mutilated .
the Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan , but often also with peasants who reject the foreign army &apos;s presence , as in Soviet times .
they want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions , even if they join the jihadists , the Pakistanis , the Arabs , the Uzbek , or the K@@ ay@@ os .
if they are even helped by local insurgents , they will no longer be able to do so when Westerners become more discreet .
the departure of the French troops on the basis of Pennsylvania , which I watched from the top of the Karen hills by the French credit , was done in order .
the lorries and tanks were returned to Kabul without suffering any attack , monitored by helicopters .
there will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014 .
the circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996 .
Kabul was then empty , and the country caught in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions .
his control over the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation , a return to security .
the Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their farmers over the age of the Al @-@ Qaeda organisation , but their situation is not better today .
the old mullahs , the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position .
the main personalities of the anti @-@ Soviet war returned to power in 2001 .
they have become speculators , taking on government land to re @-@ sell them as a solar to refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from massive outsourcing contracts .
they are discredited ; most of them have not fought .
people , as I have heard in the field , aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves .
many young people want to leave , as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity : capital flight is considerable .
young people are tired of war and of their ideologies .
they have lived through the modern world during their orders in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages .
with around 65 % of its population under the age of 25 , Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants , one @-@ fifth of the total population .
in cities , state schools are full of girls and children .
we will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties and to the corruption of certain leaders .
all of them , including the armed opposition , are engaged in mobile phones , with television and their contemporary Turkish riots producing a modern world with large fans across the country .
the army is now present .
will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate ?
former commanders of the anti @-@ Soviet struggle are already concerned about re @-@ establishing provincial militias , which will flee from central power .
Afghanistan , mountain countries , strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a degree of decentralisation to the image of Western nations . however , the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralised state , with a strong presidential power , suppressing the post of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want foreign control , particularly in the light of the elections planned in April 2014 .
however , their country is dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before .
no industry has re @-@ established its services , no packaging has been settled , and important irrigation systems have not been repaired .
everything is imported and there is nothing except fruit and vegetables .
the priority is given to private initiative .
in a country ruined after 30 years of war , government control would have been necessary .
the rumour was spread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth .
and that only increased the sentiment that the Western people were there to seize them .
without any energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the land and without the means of transport to export them through mountains , there is no mining .
the Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of M@@ a A@@ n@@ ak , leaving international archaeological agents ( financed by the World Bank ) to account for the vast numerical location and remain there as the province &apos;s most important employers .
it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports are widely dependent , to restore their normal relations .
the French troops began on 20 November .
the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : schools of girls , children &apos;s schools , a French department at university , the French Institute , military , legal , health and agricultural areas , and support for archaeological delegation .
from 2009 , in order to try to &quot; win hearts and spirits &quot; and make the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide , a &quot; civil and military &quot; service of the Ministry of Defense ( the Ministry of Defence ) , abolished in 2012 , brought in , and brought about , through a small French NGO , many work of collective interest and urban rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages .
these work , a coup for local labor , has been able to help contain the insurrection : irrigation , wells , drinking water , reforestation , fruit trees , solar protection , and increased farmland .
what will we leave as I remember after two million euros in military expenditure ?
a rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions , which are very harsh in those valleys which are often more than 2 000 metres high .
the embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals by local communities in the K@@ ren@@ sa province .
for the release of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups , which the farmers have told me they want , it would be necessary to maintain small , well @-@ controlled , civilian aid .
Egypt &apos;s Egypt Constitution
it is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi .
while Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration , which gives it provisionally full powers , it decided to play all of it .
he took everyone out of surprise on Wednesday when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day .
just a week ago , the head of state had given two more months to this House in order to complete its work .
and it is almost two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text , several times modified , which weakens institutional stability and leads the courts .
this new initiative has only increased the rift in the country .
for his opponents , the president badly in his &quot; autocratic folly , &quot; and continues to &quot; betray his word &quot; and &quot; trample on the law . &quot;
on the part of its supporters , it is ensured that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and speed up the transition process .
a referendum should be organised in the next 15 days .
a very short period of time , forcing the Brotherhood to give up its project to explain the text , Article by article , to Egyptians .
for the president , this is also a way to restore popular and democratic legitimacy as long as the controversial cause of turmoil throughout the country .
Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in favour , as he said in an interview with the American weekly weekly .
given that this resource has been voted on very quickly , it contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people : &quot; or will vote on my text , or keep the full powers , &quot; powers that will presumably come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution .
it is in that strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constitutional assembly , overwhelmingly Islamist , voted for the text yesterday .
the majority of Liberals did not go to the call .
in mid @-@ November , just before the constitutional declaration , they had closed the door because they estimated that they could not assert their points of view .
human rights representatives , religious minorities and civil society did the same .
in order for the necessary quorum to be achieved , 11 people , a replacement member , were added yesterday morning .
some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood .
as one would expect , the articles voted unanimously were unanimous .
commentators are also shouting , on the other hand , on the fact that one of the few discrepancies in the day has been expressed almost at the time of sentence , so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the constitutional clock was wrong .
the text , which was still being voted on yesterday , consists of 2@@ 34 articles .
Article 2 , which is the subject of all eyes , is ultimately still identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , which states that &quot; the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law . &quot;
the Salafi parties , for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand , hoped that &quot; the principles &quot; by &quot; the rules &quot; could be replaced , which would have enabled stricter implementation .
for Islamists , that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society .
the Liberals see this as hypocrisy , and they consider that it is not a matter of a advertising machine .
according to them , the Islamic@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
they relate , in particular , to Article 220 , which confers on the Al @-@ Islands University a consultative role , particularly for anyone who has to confirm their conformity with Sharia law .
according to the specialist in Egypt So@@ y Pomés , it is disturbing that the people called on to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy .
here , we are seeing the premises of a theocracy . &quot;
the fears of the Liberals are also increased by the fact that the next platform for the university would be far less moderate than the one .
&quot; for now , there is no specific religious involvement .
with this Constitution , we are in the framework of the civilian state .
most of the lawyers who have worked on that text are not ru@@ uc@@ ers but university graduates , some of them trained in the French system , &quot; explains Alexis Blokland , which prepares a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition .
but it recognises that there may be some ambiguity surrounding Article 220 , as the terms used to imitate religious vocabulary .
&quot; we refer in particular to the term &quot; Islamic case @-@ law &quot; .
and the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent the responsible civil judges are responsible for expressing their opinion over all of this &apos; .
beyond its religious character , the text voted on yesterday has received many criticisms which relate to the extended powers conferred by the President of the Republic .
the Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those in the former regime .
another contentious point is the powers conferred on the army .
according to the desire of the military , the Defence budget review will not be submitted to Parliament , but a national defence council .
nor will the prosecution of civilians in military tribunals be banned , as the human rights associations were calling for .
they also expressed their concerns regarding the text , which they consider to be liberalised .
the crime of blasphemy is maintained and , from now on , insults are banned , which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression , especially the freedom of expression .
in addition , no article emphasises the protection of women , stresses Human Rights Watch .
according to her , the only positive thing was the ban on torture under Article 36 .
the word was not included in the previous Constitution .
although the Egyptian President had to leave yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon .
the supporters of the head of state were demonstrating on Saturday .
in Israel , Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy land , the eyes of the world , and a sea of salt .
the promised Earth combines the maj@@ inity of biblical truths with modern comfort and nature in nature .
&quot; L@@ F &quot; identified the five most important reasons that Israel should be visited .
reverse on the Holy Land
it is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was named .
anyone who comes into this &quot; so@@ d@@ ry &quot; is thought to receive divine grace .
and Djibouti , the place of Jesus &apos;s miracles : the water conversion into wine in the box , walking on water , the appeasement of the storm , and the nets that are full .
in the same place , Jesus appeared to be in the face of his dis@@ carrot after the resurrection .
but the largest number of holy places is in Jerusalem .
the believers are travelling here with the V@@ ac@@ ru@@ ci@@ s or the Way of the S@@ ac@@ ru@@ or@@ o ( in Latin &apos; Way Do@@ or@@ ic &apos; ) .
it begins in Antonio , the Pretoria , where the trial , and continues to be on the streets of Old City , goes to the Holy burial on Mount G@@ ó@@ l@@ drop , the place of the cruci@@ x@@ ion , to the appeal of the break and to Jesus &apos; place to be buried .
in this very place , there is also the symbolic Christian hu@@ t of the world , which symbolises the salvation of mankind .
and the Holy Cross monastery in Jerusalem , built in the place where , according to a Christian script , there was a tree from which was made the cross to Jesus .
in Jerusalem , it is also the most sacred place for Jews , the murdered Wall , the remnants of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the 1970 &quot; s .
as it is a tradition , people from different religions leave them here with their wishes , which will then become a reality .
a vertical trip
the ruins of Fortress Mas@@ ada was what was left of a secret refuge against enemies , which Her@@ o@@ des the Great des was sent to build in the year 25 to - for his family .
they find mountains at a height of 450 m over sea level .
and to go there by their own means , they can only those who are involved in the escalation .
the others can reach this historic summit in the game .
and in the north of the country at a height of 16@@ 00 @-@ 2040 , there is the famous ski @-@ ski ski station , where in the months of winter there is a large influx of tourists .
until there , bus services are being offered from the centre stage .
the total length of ski lines is 45 km .
according to an old story , the mountains supposedly used to be paid gods .
visiting Single museums
there are around 300 museums in that country .
in a single trip , you are not going to visit all of them .
but it is worth visiting at least five of them , the most interesting .
these include the Israeli Museum , which is close to the Knesset ( Israeli Parliament ) .
in it , the old Man@@ or@@ ts of the Mu@@ er@@ o Sea or Qu@@ m@@ will , discovered in the Ju@@ li@@ e desert , are retained , and around 500 000 archaeological and archaeological parts .
it is worth visiting the Ar@@ te Museum in Tel Aviv .
in his exhibition of paints , he has gr@@ an@@ ri@@ ists , and ex@@ lobbying , such as Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ st@@ , , R@@ ick , C@@ is@@ ac@@ ne , S@@ is@@ ley , M@@ ud@@ te , M@@ ass@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ l@@ li@@ l , or Pi@@ married .
in Ac@@ re , the museum @-@ bathing museum is to be visited , which are some rooms of ancient Turks with model figures of visitors and bathers from that time .
it is worth going through the sole private museum R@@ al@@ li , where you can admire the cultures of R@@ od@@ in and Christ .
there are no tourist guides or tents there .
the entry is free , and categorically no donations .
the fifth , the Holocaust Museum , Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in Tel Aviv , shows one of the most dramatic pages of history .
the most tragic section is the Memorial of children , built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and the gas chambers .
he and he find themselves in absolute darkness .
stars are conspicuous .
and they sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives .
Ukraine is also mentioned .
health
the three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea , the Red Sea and the Mus@@ a Sea .
in each one of them there are swimming pools , water parks , l@@ end@@ ings , and static museums .
it is curious that in the Red Sea , it is bathing in even the winter months , because the temperature of low @-@ rate water from 21 degrees and air is up to 23 degrees .
the M@@ ino Sea is even warmer , and it is going there for the whole year .
by the way , this sea , the most extraordinary in the world , is at the bottom of the planet : 4@@ 17 m under sea level .
the blue waters there are a luxury that they easily sustain until those who are unable to swim .
the landscapes in the vicinity are truly beautiful .
people come here to move from treatment to water , to live , to die and to heal and reinvigorate their health in cases of der@@ z@@ tis , allergies , asthma , ec@@ z@@ ita , ar@@ tri@@ tis , rats , diabetes , and to put their nerves in order .
to be made out of Age
the old part of Tel Aviv , the town of Jos , on the Mediterranean coast .
that is why it was the famous maritime route that Egypt , Syria , Anatolia and Mesopotamia ended .
the city is mentioned in the old Greek and Egyptian reading .
he said that he was here that No@@ é built his kingdom and Per@@ y@@ as rescued the beautiful Ang@@ at@@ ac@@ a with whom , in this very place , he had a long and happy life .
tourists love to ride through the narrow streets that wear the names of the Z@@ od@@ o &apos;s signs .
they say that if you hit the walls on the streets of your &apos; own &apos; symbol , you will be in favour of you .
a newly @-@ married couples , who come from all parts of Israel , and even other countries , can be found to complain .
and , in C@@ ar@@ a , the city of King Her@@ o@@ des , can be interrupted by the Roman theatre , &quot; taking &quot; the strength of the game .
in Roman times , it was the main city of Ju@@ vi@@ a City and the residence of Roman surgeons , including Pon@@ cio Pilate .
the carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera shows .
memories of
if you go to Israel , do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired : in that country around 30 % of the population speaks Russian .
money for this journey would not be advisable to take it into euros , but in dollars , which can easily be changed to sh@@ é@@ d@@ els ( currently 1 @-@ 3 , 8 sh@@ é@@ e@@ els ) .
urban transport is mainly composed of buses , but in Jerusalem there is a fast @-@ track , and in Mogadishu , it is the country &apos;s only metre line , which consists of six stations and connects Lower City with Upper City .
in fact , it is an underground act .
travelling in any form of public transport costs 6 sh@@ é@@ d@@ els , and this price can travel for 1.5 hours .
in Israel , according to the Jewish tradition , the sheet is celebrated .
from Friday &apos;s evening until the outbreak of Saturday , markets and shops close and public transport is interrupted by public transport .
but Sunday morning begins a new working week .
in many butchers , restaurants and hotels , there is only lunch meal , which excludes pig meat , marital meat , fish with no beds and sites where milk and meat are combined .
there has been a broad selection of beef and lamb @-@ based meat @-@ based meat @-@ based meat and sheep @-@ based meat @-@ from @-@ sheep @-@ based meat , which is being prepared and put forward with co@@ co @-@ milk , the traditional Hebrew sun known as a wide range of nuts , a lot of red tape , dry fruit , fruit and vegetables .
street dogs are not seen in the streets of Israeli cities .
on the other hand , there are many cats who are well fed that they should &quot; earn their taste &quot; in an enormous way .
at night you can see them last night on the ceilings of the cars in question .
those around the dark people love the places in the sand and do not reject the mullahs .
a car &apos;s rent , depending on the mark , will cost from 37 $ 37 billion to 188 G@@ tz - to 188 $ 188 ( Au@@ di A6 , Volvo S@@ 80 ) , on the day .
in addition to insurance , it comes for 15 dollars a day .
and the rent for a bicycle will come out of 15 sh@@ é@@ d@@ els the day .
the tickets to museums cost an average of 30 sh@@ é@@ e@@ els .
Israel in figures
in 2012 , they visited more than three million tourists from around the world .
most of those who went to travel the country and rest were citizens of the US , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , the United Kingdom , and Ukraine .
in January 2012 , the Land Pro@@ me@@ ed Earth was visited by 1@@ 18.@@ 8 thousand Ukrainian tourists , which exceeds 51 % at the same rate of 2010 , before the visa regime is cancelled on 9 February 2011 .
&quot; the big and powerful &quot; will lead to Moscow : immigrants save for language .
as long as Members and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination , they have already appeared in the paedophile country trading with &apos; fake &apos; certificates .
every year , 13 million migrant workers reach Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
most of them are the citizens of Central Asian countries : Uzbekistan , Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
their sole aim is to earn money to help their families that have stayed at home .
since 1 December , a law will enter into force , according to which every labour immigrant person will be required to carry out a review to check his knowledge of the Russian language .
for now , this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector , Community services , domestic services and retail trade .
but , over time , as they promise in the Federal Immigration Service , examinations will become compulsory for all immigrants .
moreover , it will not be sufficient to take account of language , if not Russian history and the basis of legislation .
the knowledge of language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit .
the citizens of countries where Russia is the official language are the exception .
they will not be subject to this law by those who managed to obtain their education and diplomas certificates before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
life , fate and defence of rights
the network of screening facilities will work under the Russian Len@@ a Institute , the University of the People &apos;s Dawn , the Moscow State University , the St Petersburg State University and Russian higher education institutions .
immigrants will be able to be tested in every city , and more than 160 centres of this kind are open in Russia right now .
the initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by Members of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service .
but the defenders of rights , long before the law came into force , often managed to ask this question to the press : what will this actually bring ?
what changes will make the knowledge of language compulsory , both for Russians and for the immigrants themselves ?
firstly , the representatives of the immigration service , this will enable us to reduce the number of people suffering from &apos; labour slavery &apos; .
many people talk today about the protection of the rights of labour immigrants , explains the head of the representation of Russia &apos;s Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan .
the defence of their rights must be opened before their start .
only an organised selection system will enable migrant workers to solve the problem of 90 % of cases .
there are problems with non @-@ professional immigrants , education , those who do not know the language or pass the medical control .
without understanding the language , it claims to be static , the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who , on the pretext of helping , give him a &quot; old trip &quot; to a shocking and close co@@ hu@@ t , where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents , working from 12 to 14 hours a day .
we received a number of complaints from our immigrants .
&quot; in their homeland they promise one thing , but , if they are deceived , they are deprived of their passports , they are not paid the promised wages , &quot; he confirms the head of the professional immigration service of Tajikistan &apos;s immigration service , Tom@@ b Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v .
do not be angry , I dare to do that !
however , as long as many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognise that they do not know only the language of the country to which they intend to go , but also in their own language write with difficulty .
this , of course , is not so much his fault but his own misfortune : few of the Turkmen , Uzbek , t@@ ay@@ k@@ os who can afford the luxury of receiving normal primary education .
this is because their families even have nothing to eat to children , let alone wear them , water them and buy them what is needed for school .
by reaching adolescents , these boys venture to work at the earliest opportunity .
it is difficult , if you do not know the language , you recognise them .
&quot; you feel humiliated and inferior . &quot;
as far as the law on language is concerned , however , rights defenders point to an important point .
tests will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal .
if they do not have that status , there will be no examination and , consequently , no official work .
meanwhile , most immigrant workers are still living in Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome or prohibited for the No to strangers &quot;
many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy .
the cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself .
moreover , the legalisation costs money : 12 000 to 16 thousand ru@@ bles .
however , false registration can be done quickly , and only a thousand five hundred of them .
the employees of the Russian police know that we usually have false documents , we are not attached , and there are cases of extortion .
&quot; you are asking for a hundred or two hundred of you for cigarettes or tea , &quot; he told journalists of Tajikistan &apos;s citizens , U@@ med H@@ ä@@ k@@ ad@@ am@@ ov .
&quot; we are , not on a small year , buy a paint . &quot;
on the first day of the entry into force of the law on language , it became clear that not only refugee registration documents can be false .
a number of &quot; false &quot; certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by officials from the Federal Immigration Service .
falsified documents had been printed in colour @-@ standard bloggers .
of course , they came into the hands of new homeowners not as a gift : every immigrant , seeking to pass the test , paid for the document seven thousand ru@@ bles .
this is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure , which will cost the migrant worker three thousand stars .
the main task for the near future is to protect the anti @-@ corruption system so that &quot; diplomas &quot; cannot be purchased , government officials and rights defenders converge .
so far , the authorities can promise migrant workers that they would not have been able to proceed with the first time to study the basic course of the language .
moreover , immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people .
the Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic action against the illegal trade in weapons .
the percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is rather small .
the Ministry of the Interior proposes applying the law with greater rigidity in relation to civilian weapons owners .
this is the government &apos;s reaction to the recent incidents : to tighten up on marriage celebrations in which there were no victims , and the massacre that was initiated by the the lawyer Ad@@ co@@ vi@@ ta Dmitri V@@ in@@ om@@ o@@ do@@ ov , in which to press seven people lost their lives .
the police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for licensing for weapons @-@ carrying licences , aged 18 to 21 years .
this idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption , I@@ ina Y@@ ar@@ ov@@ aya , who promised that the reforms of the law on possession of weapons will be taken to the state Duma in the near future .
not everyone is happy about the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the &quot; hard @-@ hand policy . &quot;
there has been an open charter in the network , the authors of which , representatives of various social organisations of hooligans , demand that they be rid of such &apos; pointless &apos; measures .
the percentage of acts of hooliganism in the use of registered weapons is minimal , referred to the BBC news service from Russia , the criminalise lawyer V@@ as@@ li@@ li@@ kov .
according to the Minister of the Ministry of the Interior , for six months of 2012 , 142 crimes were committed on the use of registered weapons in organs of the interior , compared to the total of 1@@ 168 crimes registered for the same period .
the open letter authors are sure that stricter legislation in the civil @-@ use arms sector will not be a disadvantage for the criminal to go to the black market .
now , according to his words , any weapon can be found at low price in Moscow .
meanwhile , the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation in the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control .
suppliers : from factories to official
the black arms market is supplied through a number of channels .
the main channels are years , says Colonel withdrawing Victor Bar@@ an@@ nets , who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and High Staff .
trapping of the Web site that accepts arms orders
the first is a &quot; relic of the military or military &quot; - that is , the weapons that were stolen during the military action in the Caucasus .
&quot; the weapons were robbed by Russian officers and the same Caucasian , &quot; Bar@@ an@@ nets says .
the next type of &quot; black weapon &quot; is stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces .
S@@ an@@ nets explains that this includes weapons of police stores and stolen weapons directly stolen by law enforcement officials .
illegal weapons are released from military arsenals .
in many military arsenals , there were often explosions .
&quot; there are proven versions that some fires were deliberately induced to cover the absence , &quot; he comments on an ex@@ military .
according to Bar@@ an@@ nets , the arms manufacturers are also doing their bit .
&quot; now , private power factories have proliferated that are not competitive in the international market , and distribute weapons on the black market , including that of Moscow , &quot; the expert says .
a larger source of the black market is smuggling .
a large number of guns and machine machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan .
&quot; there you have its own , sometimes small @-@ scale , production , and a mafia that has organised the flow of weapons has been formed , &quot; explains the former military .
where do the weapons come from ?
experts have calculated how they share around each of these sources of supply of illegal arms to the black market .
a report on this subject was produced in 2011 by the Centre for analysing and planning public management problems .
the specialists looked at reports by the Ministry of the Interior and Ros@@ st@@ at , literary literature and public access data on the issue of weapons .
the vast majority of illegal weapons , according to researchers , come from the armed forces and the security forces .
half of the black market weapons have come there , &quot; by officials whose work is related to weapons , &quot; is stated in the report .
according to researchers , 17 % of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts , 14 % of cases are stolen during the production of weapons , and 5 % corresponds to &quot; illegal archaeological . &quot;
the dependence of one of the arms shops , which asked for his name not to be mentioned , says that the weapons found by illegal hooligans would not be buying any of them for a long time , because they are too old .
more often , it says , suppliers are directed at military stores when they need a departure .
through somewhere , the supplier buys a unit , for example , a gun @-@ powered gun .
the removal of the register and passing it over the fence .
&quot; this leads the city to the city and sells it to EUR 900 per unit with two chargers , &quot; we are aware of it .
&quot; but , of course , the police are in charge of all of the issues , so regularly , when the crime @-@ finding plan is to be met , making testing of illegal weapons traders , &quot; adds up the matter .
&quot; as in a luxury box &quot;
the seller and the buyer tend to find themselves through well @-@ known .
I visited Web pages and blogs until a type that I proposed to me to be the &quot; B@@ eg@@ o@@ aya &quot; platform , where I would be a man who would lead me to a no@@ ta , where we could negotiate .
I learned only there , &quot; I learned only of the weapon &apos;s price . &quot;
army Viktor Bar@@ an@@ nets
&quot; in order to obtain a weapon , I need a friendly friend , &quot; he says , &quot; I have a friend of the shop , &quot; but I do not trust him much . &quot;
there are sellers in the markets , but there , too , you have to get , let us say , &apos; from Mr Iversen , who asked him to be told that he had a tooth for his daughter &apos; .
I can even achieve a couple of iron man@@ op@@ e of steel through a person of confidence .
he is also giving them to me because he knows that I am not going to go along with it .
masters are looking for weapons in different ways .
the former military Viktor Bar@@ nets was put to the test in the role of illegal weapons buyer in the mid @-@ 1990 &quot; s , when it was supposed to publish an article on this subject .
the schemes , according to their words , have not changed .
he gave him a lot of photos where there was no &quot; all . &quot;
&quot; I felt like a luxury box , &quot; recalls the military .
the buyer , according to Bar@@ an@@ nets , does not offer him a cat in the eyes : everything that can be proven .
I , as a potential customer , should not only buy , and we are going to the seller , where we put a target .
&quot; you give me the chance to shoot , and when I assure you that the weapon is shooting well , we began to negotiate , &quot; the expert describes the procedure .
store of Dis@@ order
Web @-@ search engines drive sites and groups of &quot; V@@ k@@ on@@ t@@ ak@@ te , &quot; where it is offered to buy weapons &quot; for different purposes . &quot;
this requires no document or personal meetings .
&quot; it is enough to have a certain amount of money , &quot; they write in the title of the advertising warning &quot; understand a gun or a machine machine . &quot;
passengers make their orders and ask questions .
and they sell to minors ?
&quot; without permission , of course , &quot; questions to the user , &quot; I@@ án . &quot;

the Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and capture two hands for those who want to buy firearms .
and people are going , such as starving fish to sleep , and then to extract coal in Siberia .

I have heard about these systems : the website is usually recorded outside the reach of Russian laws .
people make orders .
the buyer makes the payment through an automatic box .
&quot; in response , you send you a photograph , and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden , &quot; the NGO &apos;s right to weapons NGO &quot; The right to weapons , &quot; Dmitri Barghouti .
Viktor Bar@@ an@@ nets claims that if a online request is made , you are left without a weapon and put it in prison .
the Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and capture two hands for those who want to buy firearms .
&quot; and people go , such as starving fish in the street , and then to extract coal in Siberia , &quot; he claims he is .
from $ 100 for $ 100
in the purchase of illegal firearms , according to experts , one can spend 100 @-@ 900 dollars .
in the case of the NGO &quot; The right to arms , &quot; the right to weapons , a gun can be purchased for 100 @-@ 300 dollars .
we will have to wait a month and a half .
it is sent from the military stores by middle heads .
according to official minister statistics , compared to January @-@ October 2011 , the total number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7 % , which is 22@@ ,@@ 900 , and the number of cases identified by theft and extortion of weapons , munitions , explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8 % .
workers from fast @-@ food and supermarkets in the US are on strike .
by a quarter of American teenagers , they find their first jobs as cash machines in &quot; McDonald &apos;s . &quot;
over the last few days , a wave of protest in the United States has begun on the low wages that are paid in supermarkets in the Wal@@ t Corporation , and in restaurants in the popular fast @-@ food chains , such as &quot; McDonald &apos;s , &quot; &quot; E@@ ag@@ er King , &quot; &quot; T@@ end@@ er , &quot; &quot; W@@ end@@ , and &quot; and &quot; the &quot; W@@ end@@ y &quot; and &quot; K@@ uc@@ ky Ch@@ ick@@ el Ch@@ ick@@ en . &quot;
no one dares to assert whether this wave will reach nine points , or whether it is intended to lose forces and love in its early stages .
protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left @-@ wing NGOs .
in addition to the rise in modest wages that the Wal@@ t workers and the fast @-@ food workers are paying for , the aim of the protests is the creation of trade unions for workers in these companies .
for now , this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the trade union movement .
40 cents a year ?
the actions began last week , following thank you , the so @-@ called &quot; Black Friday &quot; day . that day , in the United States , the cut @-@ out orgy of cuts that captured millions of inhabitants , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
that day , some workers at the Wal@@ t corporation , which employs 2.2 million people in the world , abandoned their jobs and formed protest towers with left @-@ wing trade unions and activists in the corporation &apos;s shops , whose products are directed at modest and moderate @-@ income people .
Lee is selling everything from its infancy , hunting and battery batteries for cars , to aspire , eggs , and milk .
products in their shops are between 8 % and 27 % cheaper than those of the larger supermarkets .
that is why many badly paid workers in Wal@@ t buy only in work .
the availability and choice of products have made Wal@@ S@@ t one of America &apos;s largest corporations .
according to the words two critics , Wal@@ se@@ t can afford to sell products at very low price , partly because it pays its workers little .
the latter also complain about poor working conditions , such as the lack of sub@@ land and hand scanners .
that &apos; Black Friday &apos; participants in the demonstration demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
for a typical Wal@@ t worker , who receives $ 9.5 per hour , this expenditure is excessive , they said .
scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Wal@@ t increases the average wage to 12 dollars per hour , this will cost the $ 3.2 trillion .
this is about 1.1 % more than it spends on wages now .
if Wal@@ t puts the increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers , every visit to the shop will be just 46 cents more expensive .
in a year &apos;s , they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12.@@ 39 more than they spend now .
Wal@@ ver@@ t &apos;s supporters agree that the protest took place in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation .
the &quot; Black Friday &quot; continued in their shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight on the next midnight , and , during that time , Wal@@ t sold around 5,000 articles by second .
in total , their Web boxes carried out &quot; Black Friday &quot; almost 100 million transactions .
the company &apos;s representative , Dan Sto@@ el@@ man , declared in an interview to the left @-@ wing Hu@@ g@@ ton Web site , which left its job of less than five &quot; Wal@@ t &apos;s employees &quot; , and that the protest had been more than &quot; another public @-@ relations trick , &quot; organised by the trade union .
&quot; the free break ! &quot;
the protests continued this week in New York , in which the targets were not precisely the large Wal@@ t stores - that in this progressive city they do not appreciate it , and so there is no one to them , but &quot; McDonald &apos;s &quot; and other cheap restaurants .
McDonald &apos;s says that he sells billions of portions , and then do not even give you the toll for disease and you do not pay you for your honest work !
the New York Council member of the New York Council
currently , in accordance with the federal and New York law , the minimum wage is $ 7.@@ 25 per hour .
fast @-@ food restaurants are growing in advance , but only slightly , and on average , ordinary workers receive in New York $ 8.@@ 90 per hour .
no one wins less than them in this city .
how it is possible to survive in New York with that money , I find that incomprehensible .
there was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald &apos;s and worked there , behind the plumbers , part @-@ time after school , although they were still living with their parents .
few people saw this as the main source of income , or plan to stay there for a long time .
now , I am constantly encountering some interviews with McDonald &apos;s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary , and sometimes even feed their children .
on the other hand , in a forum for the Wall Street Journal , there is a comment that has been made by the author that it is irresponsible to have children if it is not aware of what to eat .
the participants in the protests , which started at 6 : 30 from Thursday on Thursday in McDonald &apos;s , of the 4@@ 0@@ th Street and Mad@@ ar , demanded that the fast @-@ food machines and machines are to be paid at at least 15 dollars per hour , in other words , to double their minimum wage .
they also called for labor unions to be created in the fast @-@ food sector .
the US law prohibits the administration from suppressing this right and punishing activists of the trade union movement with claims and redundancies .
on the other hand , the administration is rarely making life easier for them .
but , for objective reasons , it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast @-@ food sector .
one of the main ones is the excessive rotation of staff .
heckling
critical protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
the completion of the action took place halfway through McDonald &apos;s in the McDonald &apos;s located near Times S@@ e@@ are , involving several local Democratic politicians , in particular , the member of the municipal council in the City of Ju@@ ma@@ ic Williamson , who said : &apos; McDonald &apos;s says that it is selling billions of portions , and then does not even give a hospital or you do not even give a hospital or pay you for your honest work &apos; .
the demonstrators received the support of other prominent New York democrats , for example , of the nominee for Mayor of the City Bill of B@@ ang@@ o , who said that &quot; we must support workers in the fast @-@ food industry to achieve fair wages and economic prosperity worthy of every neo @-@ confessional . &quot;
as the New York Times Times described , this has been the greatest demonstration of this kind in American history of fast food .
but there were only a few hundred people in it , even not all of them were employees of the rapid food service , in which tens of thousands of people in New York are struggling .
it is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark for a mass movement .
&quot; for now , deceiving the brain is not so easy . &quot;
the issue of the increased reality , which is so popular among fans of modern technologies , is recently seen with normality , mainly through the prism of special glasses .
at the beginning of the summer , at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in movement , and then in November , it was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to demand the relevant patent .
however , a conversation with the head of the interactive electronic technology group 3@@ D in the Cambridge laboratory of Cambridge , Iz@@ ri S@@ har@@ am@@ om , has clarified that for scientists from that company , glasses have already belonged to a past stage .
they attract the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with naked hands and the creation of open virtual spaces .
- ( ES ) Thank you , in general terms , what is the study of your research group ?
we are dedicated to the computer @-@ friendly interaction , but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction .
for now , humanity has been caught up at the working stage with a flat @-@ screen work , sometimes it touches the finger .
but we want to look five @-@ 10 years ahead and guess for the financial changes in this interaction .
for example , the X@@ Box and Pri@@ ec@@ t sensational represent a step forward , and today no X@@ boxes are sold without 23 000 boxes , because they are interested in the way in which they are controlled .
- what is the future for us ?
- Despite the fact that Mrs Kinnock has brought interaction to the physical level , a large part of it is still on a flat screen , sometimes in 3@@ D .
the introduction of information has improved ( the system receives more data ) , and the exit is not yet very good .
we are trying to change this , we are working in a truly triple @-@ dimensional view system based on different technologies , including design .
the computer world must be released to us , to physical , to make it more tangible .
for this , however , it is necessary to recognise not only the user but also the space that surrounds it .
then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way .
first of all , the devil is in the stupid peace @-@ loving @-@ in @-@ reality !
- What do you think about monitoring by voice ?
a very popular detail , but do you not think that it is over@@ estimated ?
whether you cannot be considered a panacea , you have to resolve the question of privacy , because you do not always want others to learn from our actions and intentions .
in fact , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in its own field .
for example , for the control of devices in public places , we had a project in which we think of gestures , but not on loose movements , but shorter .
moreover , the gestures were captured not by the house of the device , but by a do@@ ir that recorded the movement of bones and muscles .
it is now very large , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a snail &apos;s clock .
but , in general , the future is for a combined form of control , for example of a + voice .
- How is that ?
for example , how would you ask me to pass this money on you ?
you will speak , and you will show you at the same time .
I only speak .
- Well , that is going to be very difficult to recognise .
- Why do you want to force users to adapt to what can or cannot do the machine ?
that is not necessarily the case , but it is a mutual approach .
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensory , which can accurately determine the reactions of the person .
these may , for example , be sensational , as they provide a good resolution in depth , which is very important .
- If we are talking about your work with the genius of X@@ Box Kinnock , what complaints do you have from the modern chambers ?
do you need resolution , depth or anything else ?
- In principle , the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three @-@ dimensional recognition .
it would , of course , be a good thing to obtain 8 mega houses at the speed of 1000 pieces .
but the question is not about mega @-@ the size , but the quality of the parent and the depth .
from this last point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us ; this gives more work to the designers of algorithms .
in other words , we have to remember not only the resolution in the X @-@ axes and , but also in Z@@ .
the speed , the number of tables are also important .
human movements are quite dynamic , and the current 30 pieces are truly scarce , especially for gestures .
Mr Battle , from our laboratory in Raj@@ mond , made a sensory contact with re @-@ empting the processing of 1 to 100 metres , and it should be mentioned that the number of modern lights produced are closer to the second value ( 60 @-@ 100 ) .
not everyone understands the extent to which this affects the interaction of man @-@ machine .
I would be very helpful in my work for an equivalent of such a device , but it does not require contact in order to make the tables a second one .
is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras ?
- The ni@@ ec@@ t now has three &quot; cameras , &quot; one of which is in fact the underground emitter of rays , and the second the recipient of the reflected sign .
but the third chamber is , in fact , a mere sensory of visible split .
this is not used to determine the depth of the object .
potentially , more cameras could solve the problem ...
on the contrary , it will increase and increase the amount required by calculations .
it would be a good thing to create a flexible analogous way of V@@ ec@@ t , play with the man@@ v@@ v@@ í@@ v@@ v@@ in of cameras , and see how this would help to determine the three @-@ dimensional position .
- As I recall , Microsoft , unlike Google , has not presented its glasses to the public .
do you not think that , from the point of view of everyday use of increased technologies , glasses are one of the most visible platforms ?
- of course , going on all the time , with a high degree of smart phone in your hands , is not very comfortable , but I think that the best option would be an increased &apos; trans@@ table &apos; when , on the basis of a cloud platform , you could move from glasses to the intelligent telephone ,
glasses are very personal devices , that is their strength - and they can only be seen by private business - but also their weakness : an increased reality @-@ based reality will not allow him to work on virtual objects , together with other people .
- let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of black objects in the air is available not only to Tony St@@ k of the film &apos; Irish &apos; film , but also to any simple death .
there is a problem in this idea that critics tend to point out : no card answer !
they feel nothing !
what answers are your group preparing for this challenge ?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh explosion in the interaction between man and machine .
I believe that the eighth could well be the addition of to@@ to@@ to@@ t@@ uc@@ y p@@ acks .
in the meantime , one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as an image of the image .
it is a very good thing to do !
but there are also technologies that are really designed to make these &apos; images in the air fit &apos; , for example , interference from several ul@@ alities aimed at a specific point where one finds the finger , a sense similar to which one feels if someone was hanging in the fingers of the fingers , but that feeling is still very weak .
there are also press bloggers who influence the nerve spots on their fingers , which is also a promising direction .
- has he tried to deceive the brain ?
do you think that he feels what he seems to have to feel at the time he sees something ?
- That is a good idea , we have not yet tried .
here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a very long time , how to make a person physically physically located in a very small space think that it is going to an open area , almost without end , and we are also working on the idea of filling in the cabin , not as those of bloggers , and mobile platforms , as well as that of giants .
for now , to deceive the brain is not so easy , yet it still needs to be worked for for many years .
that is what makes work attractive with the virtual reality for researchers , that a lot of things are in a state of complete conception .
personal subjective staff rather than culture - Rosales ,
&apos;@@ Rosales &apos; continues the St Petersburg &apos; T@@ ed@@ er@@ ism &apos; project , which is devoted to the citizens in front of them , at the forefront of art and culture .
in this list of the best , the art figures and the Saint Petersburg scene are found , the achievements of which come beyond the city : they often find recognition in Europe without even being known to Russia .
the new &quot; Ros@@ bal@@ t &quot; hero is the bizarre M@@ ll Miller artist .
all of the city is familiar with Muham@@ ll Miller , a man of the top @-@ down red dress , which is to be found near the Russian Museum , near the Ver@@ ner of Ver@@ ano , or in fashionable meetings .
SNCF &apos;s tables always attract crowds , where they want to be displayed .
Mr Miller is one of those purely socio @-@ socio @-@ socio @-@ socio @-@ philosophers of St Petersburg , the creators of new mo@@ to@@ od@@ os .
B@@ ll Miller is a brilliant representative of the successful St Petersburg pursuit of the end of the 1980s - the principles of the 1990s .
in addition , it is an urban man , whose appearance on the streets of the city gives rise to smiles and brings all the mood to heart .
recently , he came in his hands in his hands in his hands and turned into the St Petersburg Brenner bed , as he has matured to make such a difficult role , because of his existence , his philosophy and image .
- That is the case , why are you going through the town in the dress of red and not yellow or yellow , for example ?
I chose the red colour because I am a fashion designer , and I devote myself to the appearance and image .
in this world , red color is a compromise between the artist , the masters of images and society .
although in society , everything that is not a little grey is causing nothing good .
but my provocations are aimed at initiating a conversation .
the whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate .
when did you understand that you should be an artist ?
- In an exhibition of the Culture Palace N@@ ev@@ sky , where my work was shown .
I realised that that was my way .
then the wave of old non @-@ official artists had ended , and the new , free like me , were still un@@ understood .
I was a friend of artists in the new wave , with the post to which they were exposing themselves in Gaza and N@@ ev@@ sk@@ i , which led to &apos; P@@ ush@@ k@@ k@@ ke@@ k@@ aya @-@ 10 &apos; , and the new wave has already ended .
I am in the theatre for clothing , for all genders , but not for letters .
- and all of this was brought together in your field of art - it was important to me to be at the cultural centre in St Petersburg , where the best creative minds were to be gathered .
in 1995 , I took up a territory in P@@ ush@@ k@@ il@@ k@@ aya @-@ 10 , and as long as there was no reform , there was an artistic music club , a puppet club , the home of St Petersburg &apos;s house .
many were born there : N@@ om@@ s , T@@ equ@@ el J@@ z , I recall how Sch@@ n@@ ur brought the project to &quot; The or@@ Gogh of Van Gogh . &quot;
Sch@@ n@@ ur and his friends sang the light of light in the light of the m@@ o@@ bert , who went up in line , including the now @-@ well @-@ fashionable I@@ g@@ or V@@ do@@ i pattern .
when the group began to touch in life , it became &quot; Lennart . &quot;
T@@ ach@@ ten@@ berg was an encouragement to many programmes before the H@@ ali @-@ g@@ ang@@ v@@ z@@ h era .
we gave them to Tr@@ ach@@ ten@@ berg and was the beginning of their great career ; basic education and training received it from us .
the &quot; D @-@ 137 &quot; Club , the &quot; Club Go@@ ed@@ ov , are the remains of the Ar@@ te of the Ar@@ te .
there they were our employees and diligent customers .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
in 2000 , the survey took place in the press , the prize was &quot; the people of our city . &quot;
I was elected in the nomination &apos; artist of the Year &apos; , so I came to my conclusion .
it is not comfortable to work in these new times ; I am a man who likes the truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
in our times it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are separate , and one can be popular but very little cult .
- There is a recognisable job to be done .
- Many of my paints are , in them , the present and the occurrence are clearly expressed .
I am going to make a planned exhibition , &apos; The Russian Museum in Car@@ as@@ os &apos; .
charges are a static category of words .
I was a partner earlier , but now that is the case , it is painful and terrifying .
but there is an end to the ballot boxes , and the tragedy is being removed .
I love the grotesque , I have grotesque ideas .
for example , the world &apos;s salvation by means of a totalitarian , compulsory change of clothes .
now it is followed by clothes , guided externally , but not within the person .
and , perhaps , that person should not be given the hand , not hand @-@ in @-@ hand with him in his face .
and deception will be eliminated when it comes to changing clothes .
- We have recently been seen in the role of urban bed organising . - One city must have such a hero .
who better than me to be !
well , yes , but can commercial art be beautiful ?
- Now , the art of trade must be scrupulous , sweet and touch upon .
we are witnessing the disintegration of cultures .
before the people joined together , they wanted one thing , they would like others .
now all of them have been divided into micro @-@ communities , it is difficult to please all .
I am not a 100 dollar ticket to love everyone .
we now need to think about whom you want .
now every hero of cult has his 100 fanatics .
- and in order to listen to S@@ os Mikko , they reach thousands !
- You will see the abandoned , that is the gender @-@ social area .
and there are 300 000 people , a cultural event , and 10 000 will never come , as a result , less management , less money , everything is hanging over .
I have my fanatics , the most important thing is not to deceive them , do not lose what they have achieved .
when I was a young person , I made such signs that a collection on the wall ran on the wall alongside the Far@@ k and L@@ on@@ ov side .
I started with paints , with which people usually end up .
they often confuse concepts .
they have a spiritual culture , a culture of consumption .
there is no culture in consumption ; that is another story .
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture , I grew up under the example of people who lived in poverty and died in poverty , denied money only to paint tables .
I am in favour of this culture .
- That is what is missing from St Petersburg for what is lacking ?
- Buenos experts on culture .
there is a concept : a culture official .
but not all of them can devote themselves to culture .
when kings were the right thing to be otherwise , kings may not well understand culture well , but they knew that the right experts had to be kept .
in Moscow , there are now very good consultants .
we have people in St Petersburg who could well be experts , but they are closed , because experts are needed at a higher level than to assess them properly and open them up .
now the subjective personal taste is thriving .
the same Erkel , but the difference is that they honestly say that not all the modern art is accepted , there are some artists who have to seek other museums .
- What is Saint Petersburg for you ?
- St Petersburg is not a cultural capital ; in Moscow there is much more culture , there is ground there .
but on our stones it is difficult for art to grow .
we need cultural land and we have more writers than readers now , that is wrong .
there are a lot of people in Europe with curiosity that goes to exhibitions and concerts .
in our case , this class is tiny .
we need to make art fashionable , as it was at the beginning of the last century .
the project will be implemented with a subsidy from St Petersburg .
giving birth in space
Earth is in danger .
global warming or shock with a murderer .
they are born in search of a spare planet in the field of space vessels with humans on board .
to keep humanity the main question is : how can we continue the kind in conditions of wasteful or on the same planet of spare ?
I think there is little to choose .
in fact , only two are real planets that can be colon@@ ised , at least in predatory terms .
&quot; these are V@@ ann@@ ers and Mars , &quot; says the chief researcher of the astronomical State Institute , S@@ ann@@ berg P@@ .@@ K ( IATA ) , Vladimir South Vladimir .
but if the conditions in Mars are better for life , on the surface of V@@ ester &apos;s surface , the temperature is 500 degrees .
we can only live in a large small @-@ scale city or in the orbit of V@@ ag@@ us - in space .
the reproductive problems in space with flora began to be addressed .
it is now half a century that experiments on plants were carried out .
four generations of lo@@ grown tu@@ k@@ grown @-@ in @-@ orbit were not differentiated in any way from the land varieties .
then wine @-@ rearing in the orbit , small flies in the fruit , the baby bags , was used .
in 1979 , golden eggs were sent to see how the embryo develops under conditions of greed .
we are going to achieve a normal weather as a result .
but then the problems start .
&quot; the problem is that the problem has to find support , it must be kept on its own feet and starting to move , &quot; explains Vladimir Ro@@ ch@@ ev , the manager of the laboratory for the Russian Academy of Science ( IP@@ DR ) .
by failing to find support , the weather turned out to come to chance .
and , after 10 hours in newborn babies , the instincts were swallowed up .
clouds were not reacting to the light or sound .
and the misfortune was that , after four days , they were simply dying .
&quot; and twice we managed to get the lights that were born , but then let us leave it because it was impossible to work there , &quot; commented Vladimir Ro@@ ch@@ ev on failure of the experiment in space .
the last time a biological &quot; mini &quot; was thrown into orbit 16 years ago .
experiments will continue in the spring of 2013 .
in the &quot; Bi@@ on &quot; elite , however , &quot; Bi@@ on &quot; will only travel species of the same sex .
there was an experiment with rats , which were sent to space already with disabilities .
in principle , there was no over @-@ depth .
&quot; this was precisely the elites , but this was a unique experiment , and studies such as this must be carried out , &quot; commented Vladimir Symeou .
after the landing , space rats had offspring .
however , it has not yet been possible to tackle the problem of reproduction directly in space .
it is a difficult challenge .
animals , by losing their usual habitat , simply cannot do their sexual instinct .
man , however , unlike small animals , in principle , can .
the Ho@@ o f@@ thinking has abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an appropriate emotional fund .
similar tests are not carried out on ethical grounds .
however , women have been travelling to space for 50 years .
the biggest risk happened to him .
and the most precious thing that mankind has is the female body .
we have no one in the world , and nobody on the Earth could say : if it is after a flight to space .
you may or may not have a baby after this flight .
&quot; after all , no one has responded , &quot; he comments on the senior aerospace industry , he speaks .
in June 1964 , only after a year &apos;s flight to space , the first mono@@ u@@ ta woman , Mas@@ ina Ter@@ esh@@ kova , gave birth to a daughter .
the girl &apos;s father , Fi@@ an Nikol@@ ev , was also a mon@@ na@@ ta .
in 1988 , the second M@@ au@@ ta woman , S@@ ve@@ t@@ wool S@@ avi@@ t@@ aya , who twice been in orbit and even worked in the open space , had a child .
however , the risk persists .
we are , of course , few , there are astronomical people who , after long flights , have got all of them well , and a healthy generation is growing .
&quot; and if you can say more , it is dangerous even in empty flights , &quot; it sums up the mon@@ na@@ ta pilot , a hero of the Soviet Union , a hero of Russia , Val@@ y Pol@@ y@@ ov .
however , mankind must look for some new ways in biotechnology , in radiological protection , in the creation of artificial gravity .
a compulsory stage in the preparation for flight is a compulsory phase in the preparatory centre for the preparation of the gathering .
in conditions of zero irrigation , the Dalits are practising their working skills in space .
water is pretending to be ill @-@ taxed .
if , for a adult , water is a comfortable , though still hostile , environment for a newborn child is its native element .
the small men @-@ in @-@ the @-@ art men seem to confirm that life in the land has emerged from the ocean .
there is a connection between the fact that the baby is to find approximately 9 months within its mother in the am@@ ni@@ tic liquid , as it will be easier for them to get used to the water .
in principle , this is logical , because from the moment of birth until the moment of the first bathing , it is only 2 weeks .
&apos;@@ This is very little to forget something &apos; , he says Navy Ak@@ s@@ ova , a mon@@ y@@ g@@ a for newborn coffee .
in short , if greed is a more natural state for a newly born , it is necessary for women to prevail , the force of gravity .
in the lack of greed on the chain and head @-@ in @-@ the @-@ side muscles , the ability to expel the child is reduced .
well , we ignored that , relying on the encouragement of childbirth .
you can , of course , give birth to a special house , you will push it through .
&quot; and then what ? &quot; , Val@@ i Pol@@ y@@ ov is doing this original question .
on the other hand , the child also needs artificial gravity .
without a sense of gravity , the body does not generate the ecopoint or the muscle system .
a newly born in orbit is impossible to wear with a special clothes for training , such as adults .
he will simply be deprived of what is vital for him .
&apos;@@ and this experiment that we are going to do together , by allowing a child to be born in a strange atmosphere , will result in us bringing the Earth to a disabled person , a completely non @-@ adapted person , &quot; the chief of the bioethics committee of the Institute for biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences , I@@ u P@@ ad@@ ov .
for now , the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue .
over time , however , this will be a reality , when humans in their vessels are targeting a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space .
heads of N@@ K@@ ao : inspection of the &apos; š@@ n@@ ic &apos; system has not given up to the guilty politician .
with regard to public procurement , the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation , even though its application is a matter of course .
this is what Milošević , the vice @-@ president of the Supreme Control Office ( N@@ K@@ W ) , is saying in an interview in Ak@@ tu@@ é@@ n@@ om@@ n@@ an@@ cz@@ .@@ cz@@ .
&quot; the law will never be perfect , &quot; but its implementation must be correct . &quot; I think that , in my opinion , what is lacking , &quot; in this way describes the current situation .
joint checks on Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions .
as an example of incorrect practice , he mentions the approach of Ak@@ č@@ as to the system of being self @-@ employed only on paper , which is known as the &apos; š@@ is@@ c &apos; system .
the prime minister recently said that the SDGs ( Civic Democratic Party ) would not disturb employers with inspectors ; then , is it forbidden or allowed ?
&quot; the law must be regulated in some way , and if you prohibit anything in that case , neither the president of the government can prevent the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations , &quot; noted k@@ ala .
at the meeting of the control committee in the Members &apos; Congress , you talked about the common project between the Czech and German teams , in the context of which the legislation was compared to public procurement in both countries .
what exactly is that ?
this is a parallel control which we started to make a couple of years ago .
to put it in a simplified way : European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised , this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself .
we have united everything and , although the control has not yet been completed , we have had very interesting differences , and the legislation in our country is generally &apos; stricter and more complete &apos; , but concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany .
it is therefore clear that it is not enough to introduce ever more stringent rules , but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself .
what can this project be , and what do you believe to be the conclusions ?
precisely such joint control could help us to stop investing efforts in the direction of law , reduction and improvement of limits , even if this does not have such a positive impact .
the economy of savings means achieving something appropriate at a reasonable price ( which does not always mean that the price is the lowest ) in order to prevent enrichment and , in the long term , criminal actions .
however , it is not because of reducing the allocation limit that we are going to achieve this .
perhaps because the system is saturated with so much &apos; red tape &apos; , that those who want to find failures in the system can do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now .
you talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates practice for public procurement .
how does the system of controls work in Germany ?
is a office similar to our N@@ K@@ W or is it organised differently ?
as for the offices , such as the N@@ K@@ W , there is a similar organisation to our own , the Federal Court of Auditors , with an organisation similar to our own , with a college , the only thing that , in its case , is structured in a different way , but in principle both offices are evolving in parallel .
the powers are also to some extent analogue , but as Germany has a federal organisation , the courts of accounts are even at this level , and it differs slightly from our system .
the Federal Court of Auditors ( BR@@ H ) can only control the federal money , which we call state funds here .
the public funds , which are administered by the regions and municipalities , there , in Germany , are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors .
as regards local legislation , is it simpler than ours ?
I would , in general , not like to establish a comparison with no specific data , but Germany is still a model in some respects , but it cannot be made clear exactly what is best .
could it be better , for example , in terms of the quality of the inspectors ?
that is certain not , but , I repeat , I do not like to make this kind of comparisons .
it must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face up to a large number of problems .
if that were not the case , it would be no benefit to you working with our office , did you not think ?
with regard to the legislation in our country , what did your Office mean by the amendment of the law on public procurement , and is it in any way apparent ?
in view of the fact that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , it has not yet been expressed in control .
since we carried out ex post controls , we must have a certain delay .
for the time being , we are seeing in the process of preparing future controls : we have launched a new &quot; non @-@ economic risk detection &quot; tool , whereby we have made it almost 14 public procurement , which have been analysed . the changes will be fully reflected here , as the conditions for some types of selection and similar procedures will be rectified .
does it consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that , rather , it is a mess for the bureaucratic system ?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this will be the case .
the problem which may arise is that the rules should be tightened up and that it is impossible to comply with it .
with previous regulations , the controlled people were linked to the contractor ( for example , in regional operational programmes of the regional council ) , and each non @-@ respected public contracting law meant that budgetary discipline was violated .
does it make sense then to tighten up the law in this way ?
I think not in this way .
the system must exclude those who want to attack it or exploit it and not punish those who commit a formal ruling , which has no effect on decision @-@ making .
a system of this kind will only create more bureaucratic pressure .
and how does it come out of this ?
we will see where we are going in this direction .
the prime minister recently stated that the SDGs would not disturb employers with controls in the so @-@ called š@@ n@@ ic system , with reference to the fact that it would be self @-@ employed only on paper : what does this mean ?
is the š@@ n@@ ic system prohibited or allowed ?
the law must be regulated in some way and , if it prohibits anything , then even the government &apos;s prime minister can prevent the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations .
you can say : &apos; we change the law , we allow it &apos; , but you cannot say that we will do as though .
in the law on public procurement , the rules are quite strict as to the way in which a formal action is to be taken , and that is how it should be to protect public competition .
but , on the other hand , it is tragic that the candidate is excluded from the best offer for failing to comply with formal requirements .
the law will never be perfect , but its implementation must be correct , and that is , in my view , what we are lacking .
the roads are present ice plates , although most of them are usable .
in several places in the Czech Republic , roads are in ice and ice plates .
even though most of the routes are possible , caution must be taken in some cases .
region of Kar@@ ward and Varosha .
today , the roads in the Kar@@ ward and Varosha region were susceptible , but they were ice and snow plates .
the temperature is falling and the temperature will vary from five to ten degrees below zero , and in the day , it will rise slightly over the clock .
it has stopped sleeping in the region and in low @-@ water areas the snow layer is fine .
on the other hand , it is almost 30 centimetres from the Ti@@ tes Me@@ gi@@ os Me@@ ul@@ ul@@ es .
in some places , visibility was still bad because of the fog , according to information from the region &apos;s road trading centre .
the rapid R@@ 6 path and the first @-@ class road in the region are now smooth @-@ free .
however , it is recommended that caution should be extreme , particularly in a number of bridges whose surface may be dry and slippery .
in addition , all the second and third category routes are also possible , including mountain roads .
however , in some of them there are still sections with ice remnants and wet snow .
there is a need to increase attention in the road , especially in the higher areas .
region of Par@@ hesitation and H@@ BS K@@ rem@@ lo@@ ck
on some of the roads in Bohemia , there is a danger of snow and in higher areas , and in the mountains there may have been a snow layer on the roads , reports on roads and motorways are reported on its pages .
road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice plates , especially in higher areas of the Par@@ hesitate region .
they can take ice back in the vicinity of L@@ š@@ k@@ ro@@ a , Se@@ a@@ í n@@ ad Or@@ ang@@ í , Po@@ li@@ č@@ ky , S@@ ord@@ it@@ inger or V@@ y@@ so@@ k@@ é@@ k@@ é@@ k@@ é@@ k@@ é@@ k@@ é@@ k@@ é@@ k@@ é@@ ho , and above all on the second and third category roads .
roads I / 43 and I / 34 in Sonik have been criminally treated .
there is snow in particular on the roads in the Kr@@ k@@ on@@ o@@ š@@ o mountains to Or@@ gi@@ k@@ é Hory .
there is a snow layer swimming at the top of the roads in the municipalities of Gy@@ ch@@ ov n@@ ad Nikol@@ ul@@ ad Akbar ž@@ no@@ u and Truth .
in the East Turkestan area , the sky is now , and is to be found , cleared up , without rainfall .
temperatures will typically vary from zero to zero , and a positive tone will mark a weak wind .
region of Pilate
the roads in the Par@@ sen region are a way forward today , even if caution is to be done , and it will be necessary to adapt to the time .
in the early hours of the morning , there will be snow@@ one , temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero .
after snow and the subsequent decline in temperatures , some routes could also be covered by ice .
in some places drivers will be in fog , but visibility will gradually improve .
that is what emerges from the information from the centre for the control of road operations in the region .
the D@@ 5 motorway is almost without restrictions , although it is recommended that caution should be extreme , particularly on the road between kilometre and 131 .
the surface of most first @-@ class roads is dry and ice @-@ free .
there may be sections on ice plates in the C@@ es@@ sen road area and T@@ ach@@ ov border with Germany .
the second and third @-@ category routes are wetlands , so that , in this case , there is also a warning of sections with ice plates .
drivers should be more cautious , especially in the less @-@ than @-@ used tracks in the Wall@@ u@@ va area .
region of O@@ lo@@ mo@@ ag@@ es
drivers who run to the top parts of the O@@ lo@@ mo@@ ar region will find partly out of the ground .
after the chemical treatment , it was still snow at the port of Č@@ er@@ u@@ g@@ le@@ o@@ sk@@ é and the way in the direction in the direction in the direction in the direction in the direction in the direction of V@@ id@@ el@@ sk@@ u@@ sk@@ ž@@ k@@ burg .
road operators took over the snow during the night ; on the baby road , around three centimetres were accumulated , according to the route managers .
in the rest of the region , most of the avenues are non @-@ restrictions .
&quot; in the top of the highest on the road of Wall@@ r@@ per , there is a fall of snow .
the drivers in the port of Č@@ er@@ ven@@ o@@ u@@ sk@@ é will be in a half @-@ half @-@ hearted the way to Christ , &quot; he has today confirmed a voyage administration on the road to the Č@@ T@@ K roads .
on the ground , and at night they went to Christ , and , after chemical treatment , the lines of the highest zones are now clear @-@ cut and hot @-@ headed .
on the road of O@@ lo@@ ro@@ fication the routes are non @-@ restrictive , in the case that the drivers should be driven with caution in the forest sections , where they are still wetlands .
part of the European People &apos;s Party and the region of Liber@@ ec
the road operators in northern Bohemia reported on complications in different sections early in the morning .
apart from a few places where it has snow@@ ed or ice , according to the police database the mountain of the mountain between T@@ ni@@ a and K@@ n@@ ce in the region of the last month , the N@@ ad Ol@@ em is closed .
temperatures are kept under zero , even in the lowest areas , so ice and snow are obviously kept in the cold ; instead , in the lower @-@ down areas , especially in the south @-@ east of the Czech plant , there are no problems , and the roads are generally dry .
there have been no complications as a result of this .
the road operators have warned of the ice presence in the vicinity of Mrs Sandbaek .
according to weather , conditions have been ideal during the night , and rain and snow are expected to break down and in the evening the sky will be open and ice .
from the general roads , there have been adverse conditions in road I / 13 , at the border between the twenty @-@ first of the region of New em and Liber@@ ec .
the road between T@@ ni@@ a and K@@ n@@ ce had to be cut back by the branches of the trees that had been archaeological on the path with the weight of snow .
we want to build on positive energy at our concerts : at our concerts we want to build up positive energy .
it is said that in a little less than a month it is going to come to the end of the world , what is your opinion on this ?
it is just one of the many other alarmist news that we like to seize .
the T@@ PA T@@ PA is more like a joke about this , and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to bring enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it .
moreover , in December you organise a truly original project : three concerts against the end of the world .
can you explain that to our readers ?
this is a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art act that we have been planning for two years .
we decided to take advantage of the marketing potential which has the end of the wider calendar at the table for 21 December at 11 : 10 a.m.
the previous day , on 20 December at 21 : 00 , we will organise three simultaneous concerts in Prague , Br@@ no and O@@ me@@ va .
it will be about about the same time when the New calendar in the Pacific Ocean expires 12 hours ahead of our time zone .
who did this idea happen ?
initially , it was my idea , then we were once again forged the project together with our Al@@ za Al@@ za A@@ likes .
in addition to wanting to bring enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world , we also want to reflect , together with society , on the state of which we leave the world to our children .
on the occasion of the end of the May calendar , we have also set up a single list of articles : g@@ w , T @-@ shirts , stock exchanges , and original keys to the end of the world that can be acquired at www.@@ and @-@ plug - Yes , another way of supporting us .
the T@@ PA T@@ PA , together with other interpreters , also sang the so @-@ called anthem against the end of the world , which takes a title &quot; F@@ in of the world , cancelled . &quot;
at the moment , is it very popular on YouTube , can it be heard at the beneficial concerts ?
of course , and it will be right , and it will be right , provided that everything goes well and the world does not end ...
they will sing all the interpreters at the same time in the three concerts .
the anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously by means of special broadcasting in the Czech television .
the letter of this song has been written in the song of the song and interprets the leading role of Jesus in ca@@ e@@ oc@@ lip , where he is also wearing X@@ is@@ l X ...
how did this cooperation arise ?
we work together even with other personalities on the Czech cultural scene , apart from organising many beneficial acts and concerts ...
we are making every effort to participate in this project .
it has been shown that most of them are interested in and love to work with us .
what will the money raised at the concerts against the end of the world be spent ?
equipment for the education centre without the fiscal barriers , which we have been carrying out in its sixth year in a row with the T@@ PA civil partnership in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ ac@@ et@@ ud@@ k ov .
the pupils of the J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ uc@@ č@@ ov school school regularly receive a visit by teachers with those who carry out interesting and interesting activities .
pupils do not have sufficient economic means to pay for teachers and we do a e@@ force or to make it possible .
in the context of the completion of the works in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ ul@@ ov v , there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project .
there are various groups and interpreters in each concert .
what are the selection criteria ?
we are trying to draw up a programme that is attractive to all generations , including children .
for example , in Prague it will act Ch@@ im@@ as@@ ki , Su@@ p@@ port Lesotho , I@@ rain , I@@ rain , with Dan B@@ ár@@ ta , The T@@ PA T@@ PA , Mari@@ án B@@ go , and Ji@@ ř@@ í Su@@ ch@@ ester .
in order to obtain more detailed information , you will be able to consult www.@@ k@@ p@@ k@@ a@@ k@@ .@@ cz@@ .
do you envisage any other &quot; spectacular action &quot; in the future ?
in May , for the first time in May , we will be taking part in the ironic festival in Prague , which we will be preparing for an attractive programme with interesting guests .
next year , we would also like to touch on the Daily National Hall of New York and myself , personally , taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States , I would like to complete it in Washington and Chicago .
your foreign plans are not exactly minimalist , up to now , for example in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
the PDB is , however , a group of people with disabilities .
how is the logistics and organisation of these journeys ?
it is not so difficult how it may seem at first sight .
there are five members of the power @-@ wheel chair , chairs must travel on baggage to luggage , and we also have a great deal of weight , the boxes with the instruments ...
so far , however , we have managed to get it right , as the Č@@ SA and British Airways have managed to do , and they were perfectly ready , and I am surprised at that .
even in Moscow , where we recently returned , there was everything without problems .
thanks to the exit from abroad , you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects .
what do you have in mind up to now ?
in Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities , everything works better than here ; in Russia , we have seen that there is a long way to go .
unlike Prague , Moscow is full of barriers , it is still not often the case that a person is moving alone at the center of the city in a power @-@ wheels .
something as usual as it is , for example , to give preference to someone in the lift , there it is not .
fortunately , a civil partnership has been created that is endeavouring to boost the problems of people with disabilities .
in which areas should we take the example of more developed countries ?
there are many aspects to which we are behind ...
but it is important to mention that improvement and improvement of the situation always depend on the people to which they are directly affected .
in London and Madrid , it is quite normal for people with a serious disability to move on their own in public and to go to service , to the museum , where they want ...
however , it is not common that a large number of disabled people are actively involved in social life , in this respect , with The T@@ PA T@@ PA , we are going a little bit ahead !
a free @-@ and @-@ friendly society is one thing , but when the moment comes when eminent sportsmen , artists , players , politicians , or lawyers emerge , they will start to change everything in truth .
so far , these are isolated cases of people who have a great will .
the T@@ PA Group is currently very popular , but if we look a few years ago , what did you set the group in 1998 ?
I took as a teacher in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ ci ov , where he had a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote himself to something .
and since I am a copy of my own , I am one of my fellow Members , the Cor@@ x@@ op@@ a , I set up a love group with a colleague of work .
and , over time , as our facilitator Bakiyev put to Angel@@ o@@ š@@ i@@ bo , we were a bit of a hand , to be left ( laughter ) .
but popularity has not reached up to these last few years , or am I mistaken ?
it is true that we were very much helped by the fact that we were connecting with famous ones and also working actively to promote the group .
we concluded that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist .
thanks to European Union aid , we can also afford quality teachers , equipment , etc .
is it going to go so far with The T@@ PA T@@ PA ?
from the start , I saw the potential that there had been , that something can be done in another way .
the world of the spectacle is full of things that look like one another .
it is logical , in its own way , all the new is to be welcomed and takes a very long time to be accepted .
there are few extraordinary things , but I dare say that The T@@ PA T@@ PA is one of them .
the impression of someone who sees us for the first time clearly is compassion , is a natural reaction ...
but compassion is totally superfluous because disabled people are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we must have compassion .
there are people who can live a full life and develop , on condition , of course , that they have the necessary means .
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities , then it is not just a step forward for them , but for society as a whole .
did you help the fact that you are the head of a demanding head , as many people describe you ?
if we want to do quality work , we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline .
I think it is quite normal .
some people arrive with a romantic vision , and with their head in the clouds , and when they have to go to two days to test , go to the preparatory test , and spend a great deal of time travelling , and in concerts , initial euphoria will soon leave them quickly .
but that is how it works everywhere , in every group that wants to work and achieve something .
today , the T@@ PA T@@ PA has twenty members .
how many of them were already at the beginning of 1998 ?
it is only one : Barghouti to Angel@@ o@@ š@@ i@@ bo .
we are an open group , people are entering and it comes , it cannot be avoided .
anyone who is willing and willing will always find the doors open .
that will be the day before the expected end of the world , on Thursday 20 December 2012 at 9 p.m.
it will have a place in the Prague In@@ ch@@ ba Ar@@ ena , in the wearing of Br@@ no and in P@@ y@@ no@@ j@@ em in O@@ r@@ a , and will involve 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic .
the three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through video conferences to set up together the song of the T@@ PA Group &quot; F@@ in of the world , cancelled . &quot;
the concert &apos;s aim is to bring together the resources needed to finance multifunctional training facilities in the education centre without the pre @-@ border barriers in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ ach@@ k@@ rit@@ ov v in Prague , the cost of which amounts to 25 million Czechs .
entry into concert costs 400 C@@ Z@@ K , and children up to 12 years have a free entry into the pre @-@ selling option for early sales .
Poland and the cosmo@@ s .
at the ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency countries held last week , Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA , which is the ESA in the former Eastern European bloc , after the Czech Republic , which became a full member on 12 November 2008 .
Poland initiated intensive collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years participated in the agency &apos;s draft projects .
however , Poland &apos;s path to darkness began much earlier .
Polish enthusiasts were already involved in flight flights before World War II , although their work was not always understood .
I recall , for example , the conference on 6 December 1933 , Mrs Hoff , the conference on 6 December 1933 , at which she presented her ideas on the pioneering study on &apos; In@@ br@@ alisation . &apos;
the ideas of the young engineer , which was born in 1905 , left indifferent assistants , and , a few years later , Š@@ u@@ feld reminded us that Dr Jan G@@ ad@@ ski had been the only one who had been interested in his work .
in France , the Sakharov Prize in France was awarded by Robert E@@ n@@ ar @-@ Peltier and André Louis Hirsch for his &apos; In@@ br@@ alisation to the Highlands &apos; .
Dr Jan G@@ he@@ om@@ ski ( 18@@ 99 - 1966 ) , I mentioned earlier , became a major driver of astronomical and mon@@ ge@@ tics .
it wrote hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline .
Bo@@ om@@ ski became a promoter of the mon@@ th@@ tic , was known around the world , and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put on one of the thyroid in the hidden face of the moon .
as early as 19@@ 25 was built in Poland a d@@ ine that was to be equipped with a rocket engine .
unfortunately , it is unknown who was the author of the proposal , and there is no mention of those who are removed from the proposal .
it is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for grubbing up or to stop it .
information about this d@@ ine is limited to the collection in the press of the time .
from 1933 , the Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles .
the investigation was funded by the K@@ om@@ é@@ ka Technology U@@ z@@ j@@ ki U@@ z@@ ac@@ d@@ a@@ u@@ a@@ u@@ a@@ u@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ z@@ y@@ y@@ z@@ y@@ z@@ y@@ z@@ y@@ z@@ y@@ z@@ y@@ z@@ y@@ z@@ y@@ em , G@@ st@@ aw@@ em Mo@@ z@@ y@@ ki@@ ki@@ eg@@ im .
from retained material , it becomes clear that research came to the stage of the practical tests .
with the arrival of the German troops , however , research was suspended .
in 1937 newspaper , the specialist press appeared in the prototype of a photo @-@ cheese missile designed by the Ro@@ ho@@ z@@ z@@ č@@ z engineer , and the following year was published the &quot; R@@ ak@@ is@@ ta &quot; study , &quot; R@@ ak@@ is@@ va g@@ wi@@ ac@@ man@@ va z@@ an@@ ob@@ om@@ es@@ i@@ y@@ ba L@@ um@@ za , &quot; of author L@@ eli@@ wa @-@ Kr@@ z@@ y@@ w@@ ho@@ ki .
both projects were aimed at the military use of missile engines .
shortly before the war , the interim scientific advisory committee ( of course , in the words of Ko@@ r@@ cz@@ ar@@ w@@ and Ko@@ u@@ et Dor@@ ad@@ ai@@ i @-@ N@@ au@@ k@@ ow@@ y ) , was faced with all projects on missile techniques for military use , and coordinated all the work .
the committee was founded in 1937 , but after two years of activity , it was interrupted by the start of the war .
other studies dedicated to the mon@@ an@@ logy appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of astronau@@ ts ( Pol@@ la@@ y T@@ ow@@ ag@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ w@@ y@@ cz@@ ne ) .
in November 1954 , 1954 , there is reference , for the first time , to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronau@@ ts .
in one of them , in the case of Mr McIntosh , Mr McIntosh , he was proposing the creation of a society which would be allocated to the mono@@ mon@@ tic age .
artificial satellites had already been put in place at that time , and it was obvious that co@@ logical research was a future discipline .
from the beginning of 1956 , the Polish Polish Society ( P@@ TA ) sought to be part of the International Federation of astronomical astronomical ( founded in 1951 ) , and in autumn of that year the P@@ TA became a full member .
the next year &apos;s first Chairman of the P@@ TA , Kazakhstan , Kazakhstan &apos;s ( 19@@ 02 - 1959 ) , became the vice @-@ president of the International Federation of astronau@@ ts .
he took this position until his death in 1959 .
since 1956 , the P@@ TA took a significant role in the development of the R@@ ak@@ an@@ om@@ or@@ om@@ or@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ y@@ cz@@ na rocket , which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out .
the R@@ M @-@ 1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958 .
the rocket had a 1.8 @-@ metre boom , about 80 m long , and it did not reach 5 kg .
later , the R@@ M @-@ 1A version was finished to be built , and , in the summer of 1959 , the R@@ M @-@ 2 missile tests were launched in the B@@ ł@@ eg@@ ve@@ w desert .
the rocket rocket was 1.4 metres , weighing around 1@@ 1.5 kg .
another type of developing rocket was going to be the subject of real scientific study , with R@@ M @-@ 34 rocket to a peak of 14@@ .5 km , and their mission would be to control the wind of the weather .
in 1962 , however , the work was suspended .
the &quot; R@@ M &quot; type , the successor , was the R@@ M @-@ style rocket @-@ 1 rocket , which was built during the 1962 and 1965 years .
it was designed as a two @-@ stage rocket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 c@@ m and an initial weight of 3@@ 2.5 kg .
three types were developed ( called Me@@ e@@ or 1a , - 1@@ B and - 1@@ C ) , which differed from each other for the space available for scientific equipment .
the space available for the volume of 0.4 litres , in the Me@@ e@@ or @-@ 1@@ B volume of 0.@@ 34 litres , and in the Me@@ e@@ or @-@ 1@@ C volume of 0.@@ 62 litres , is in the Me@@ e@@ or 1a area .
the maximum peak in the three types was 37 km .
between 1965 and 1968 it was in the Air Institute or the Me@@ e@@ e @-@ 2 rocket institute , the initial air tests of which started in October 1970 .
the rocket @-@ 2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to bring a useful weight from 10 kg up to 60 km .
the Me@@ e@@ - @-@ 2@@ H version and Me@@ e@@ or @-@ 3 were then built .
it is also necessary to mention Poland &apos;s entry into the Inter@@ PR ( Convention for Research Area Research ) in the 1960 &quot; s , and the formation of the National CO@@ IP committee two years later .
within the framework of the interim programme , Poland joined in the investigation of the cable space on artificial Soviet satellites and , in 1978 , the Polish pilot Mir@@ sh@@ os@@ ley Her@@ ham@@ z@@ ski was turned into the second mono@@ ag@@ u@@ n@@ ta after the Second R@@ TA .
suspension of the law on social work is not the solution .
last week , the constitutional trial suspended the social drilling law .
the resolution caused a heated discussion in society .
it will certainly be interesting to examine the problems from a broader point of view .
liberal economic systems in the EU , as in the globalised world , are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation .
consequently , this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other .
the cause lies in the principle of free trade and the unrestricted free movement of private capital , together with unbridled financial speculation .
the effect of large differences in labor costs ( wage costs ) produces economic tensions .
under this concept , it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer , with the import of cheap goods , is trying to shorten distances and , in order to do so , &quot; leads to a decline in the price of competitor with the aim of getting more of the market , and thus to increase its profit margins .
on a large scale , it means , for the majority of employers , moving production abroad , buying more cheaply or less . the result is high unemployment in countries where the price of labour , compared to other economies , is higher .
because private capital does not have any social responsibility and , in so doing , is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates , it is necessarily increasing the social spending of the state .
all of this leads to the employers &apos; total lack of interest in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for profit .
the situation is universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data .
the unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations , in certain economies , in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population and thereby attracting foreign capital to the country .
in other words , governments are making private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline .
this is particularly evident in the changes to the laws in force .
the aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital , especially with regard to wages .
this takes place , on the one hand , through the system of economic obligation in the case of long @-@ term unemployment ; on the other , by the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights .
the result is growing poverty , together with the increase in differences between poor and poor people .
for a number of years , there have been food delivery points for poor people in Germany who cannot stand on their own work .
the number of people receiving this type of aid is already 1 million .
in the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy , there is a fairly frequent case : people employed with such a low wage that the state should pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive .
a scandal of this kind has been made public with the situation of employees of the German federal parliament .
the savings measures of virtually all the southern EU states lead , without doubt , to the same situation , and people , under pressure from a deep @-@ seated social @-@ level decline , are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century , or to ill @-@ living with an appalling wage at the level of society , in the hope that the private private capital of capital will one day come to the country .
does it need to be asked where it comes from ?
in the case of other EU countries , then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives , as Chinese , Indians , Brazilians , Turks , Moroccans , Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European salary .
this also affects the whole of Latin America .
liberal theories and the media claim to the extent that the state should not provide capital to the economy , to lead the economy , leading to its failure .
private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control .
next , it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political march and thus throughout the state .
in this case , the answer is clearly yes .
the test is the existence of lobbies , in very powerful and pervasive practice , in all states .
the result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption , mutual favours , legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable .
in Germany , the situation is as follows : state ministries , in the absence of financial means , carry out the drafting of law projects to private legal companies , which are often linked to industry .
this type of bill is then approved by the Bundestag , the German parliament .
in this way , all power does not come from the people , as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies , but by the strong financial groups that represent their own interests .
it is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation will quickly find themselves in a situation in which it is what the Roman crisis of the Roman Republic &apos;s crisis of Caesar &apos;s time describes . &quot; the state has been disintegrating , and administrations were in force . &quot;
in exchange for bribes , favours obtained legitimately and aid to finance stones or horrors .
bribery and corruption spread without any impediment , and people catch the ballot box with the &quot; yes &quot; vote in advance &quot; - &quot; there were no people to aspire to a post in administration , so once , because of this breakdown , the state has been in serious talk of the only remedy for such a serious situation , and that a strong man was needed to choose , and it needed to choose a powerful man &quot; ... , and it was necessary to get Caesar from power .
the conclusion , just as in the past , is that today &apos;s society is based on non @-@ considered preferences without taking common interests into account .
private capital is not , in essence , able to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole .
the result is the same as that of then , the collapse of the unprecedented elite , without an effort being made to reform it in depth .
the causes of the boom in fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalisation of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth century .
with respect for the current situation , it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy such as a fixed break , pending the next coup .
the truly damning fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives , social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed , as well as crimes against humanity , as we know them in ancient and recent history .
suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution ; at least not in the long term .
under pressure from economic competition , both internationally and within the EU , the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek other ways of reducing the social level of the population .
this trend is therefore systemic .
the solution is through concrete socio @-@ political reforms , which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state .
Israel : the laboratory of chaos .
&quot; that he noticed , &quot; he noticed , &quot; does not come out of the violence , and nothing could happen ) ; he could not do anything about the violence , and the refrain of saying that the refrain is &quot; L@@ et &apos;@@ us does not dictate to us , &quot; - let us not forget how fragile we are .
&quot; if my children would not want wars , there would be no &quot; Gu@@ ec@@ e Sch@@ n@@ re@@ er , &apos;s wife of Mayer Am@@ sch@@ sch@@ el Rothley , on his death bed in 18@@ 49 .
after the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip , there have been , as always , different reactions .
one , on the Israeli side , argues for the Palestinians &quot; right of self @-@ defense , and the other support the Palestinians , and calls for racism by the Palestinians by the state of Israel , genocide against Palestinian Arabs , and accusing Israel of a terrorist state .
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the regularly repeated killings and who is the victim ; after all , today &apos;s citizens , including the self @-@ employed , were born in the current political situation , and they did not live in the beginnings of violence .
my intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain , a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years ( calculated from the Bal@@ 4 Declaration in November 1917 ) in a small area of land in the Middle East .
some of my considerations are based on historical facts , others in conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter , on who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history .
in mankind &apos;s history , the history of power struggles is in the front row .
in each day , we can find a Alexander Mag@@ no or a Napoleon .
but what is no longer so obvious is whether it is always these people who run their steps in an autonomous way , or if behind their counterpart there were someone who guided their actions towards a certain objective .
we must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of money and the power of this money has not been able to reach a single generation .
among these astronomical @-@ rich families highlights one that might be considered the most prominent ( if there is still someone behind me , I do not know , but I do not rule it ) : the Roth @-@ sch@@ d .
not much is written close to them .
naturally .
in the 1990s , the first news agency was purchased by the first news agency to stop linking its name with serious criminal acts , with power and wealth , or both , covering them behind them , which for them always meant a strengthening .
they are important in almost all central banks in the world , and in those countries where they are not represented , a war has been declared or is being prepared : before the attack on Afghanistan were seven countries , after the attack on Iraq , after the attack on Gaddafi , there were only four left behind the bombing of Gaddafi , but Russia has now made the central bank subordinate to the Russian government .
anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Roth @-@ DE of America , began during the War of S@@ ass@@ in to print money , and was murdered in 18@@ 65 in the theatre .
J@@ F@@ K began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system ( EDF ) , and was murdered in 1963 , by the commentator Louis McMillan F@@ ad@@ den was poisoned by 1936 after wanting to demand the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929 .
their pursuit of global power has led them during the 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 - to draw up a plan with three world wars , designed by the Cha@@ on Albert Pi@@ ke , in the form of 33 .
the first war was aimed at eliminating the big mon@@ ical states across Europe ; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy , especially from Britain , and the third wanted to reduce the land &apos;s population between half a million people ( such a number of slaves to their welfare and luxury would be enough ) , and the creation of a universal religion - is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution , and the definitive adoption of absolute powers .
the method with which the richest families &apos; group is operating , together with the Rothley , follows the dynamics of the outbreak of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution ( order from chaos ) .
these solutions are , however , wrong , and they will always lead to a deterioration in the situation . if not , it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 19@@ 07 was not repeated .
so , after the success of the heir of the heir to the Austro @-@ Hungarian tri@@ er@@ o @-@ Hungarian , Francis Fernando , in Sarajevo , and after the First World War was unleashed , Muslim @-@ ist Russia destroyed the Bolshevik revolution .
the First World War ended in a sudden and unjustified military and economic sense , Germany &apos;s capitulation ( the wars to put an end to partisan Russia were already unnecessary ) , and the subsequent break @-@ up of the great power of Central Europe , the Austro @-@ Hungarian empire .
to prepare the ground for the Second World War , they allowed bankers and politicians , in a covert way , to create a conflict in the wake of the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany , creating the optimal conditions for the impoverished masses , and they were given the Germans the right @-@ to @-@ blame solution to the Germans , and then set up a number of nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represented the fifth column , which set out the fifth column , which set out the fifth column , which set out the fifth column , which set out the fifth column , which set out the fifth column , which set out the fifth column , which set out the fifth column , which set out the post @-@ war function of the fifth column .
at the end of the nineteenth century , the Roth @-@ il pushed for the foundation of the Zionist movement , an arm that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state , preferably in the former Ju@@ vi@@ es region with Jerusalem as a capital ( return to Si@@ ón ) .
the previous declaration laid the foundations for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab people of the place .
terrorist attacks on both sides were produced .
the Second World War emerged : it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the line that international bankers had to match at the beginning , or if everything he did was part of a plan ; however , the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society .
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and similarly to the way that the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for the Second World War , with the proclamation of the state of Israel created for a third war .
if international bankers managed to launch it , the Jewish nation , as in the Second World War , would become victims of the first line of fighting , now together with the Arab or , generally , Muslim population in the Middle East .
Israel is an immense laboratory , a breathing machine and chaos , not only within the framework of the country , but also at international level , as an example of how the supporters and opponents of Israel are firmly divided .
who is guilty , and who is the victim in the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict ? where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence , if at the start of all the greed of some individuals and their pursuit of world power ?
here , we need to distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders because , as in our country , international bankers only present their candidates in elections .
Israel &apos;s current President B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politics , loyal to international bankers , who are doing everything possible to declare war on Iran and , considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan ... ) , would threaten to become a global conflict , and , if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Or@@ mu@@ z , where 20 % of all world oil is spent ( the navigation corridor comes to only two miles ) , it would lead to the destruction of the world economy .
in what light is the words said in 1994 : &apos; we need only a general crisis , and people will agree with a new world order &apos; .
the new world order in its imagination is a world of men and slaves .
a world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well @-@ well @-@ off financial aristocracy .
a world in which every new individual is given a chip at the birth that controls everything .
&apos;@@ and forces everyone , small and large , rich and poor , free and slaves , to have a mark on the right hand or on the front , not to buy or sell , unless they take the name of this monster or the figures on their behalf .
it is necessary to understand this : anyone who has fingers on the back , which will add the numbers in this monster .
the number marks the person , and this number is six hundred and six .
Lord Ar@@ go : if you put crude oil , call a Hollywood
in November 1979 , a group of Islamist students &quot; demonstration took place in the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 @-@ sided hostages as hostages .
his release was going to be in exchange for the break @-@ up of sh@@ ha@@ h Mohamed P@@ á@@ h@@ le@@ le@@ é , who , after the revolution , fled to the US , a country that had sponsored his regime for decades .
for the American administration , the situation did not offer any positive prospect : to throw the g@@ ha@@ h out , it could not be allowed , since , if it did , it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries .
but the release of hostages in Iran , where the revolution had led to the theocratic regime &apos;s constitution , was not within its reach .
it was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which subsequently intensified even further with the failed attempt to free hostages by force .
prison diplomats were released 4@@ 44 days after the intervention of the Algerian Government .
in the US , its destiny caused a wave of solidarity and assertiveness against Iran .
the failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election .
the film &quot; Ar@@ go &quot; from the head @-@ in @-@ in @-@ the @-@ head Ben actor , an episode in this story , which won a small success for America .
shortly before he took the embassy , six employees were escaped from the building .
after a complicated time , they ended up in the Canadian embassy &apos;s residence .
CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , managed to extract them from Iran , this helped a covert story a covert point : they came with Canadian passports , as members of the film team that looked at the country &apos;s location for the establishment of science @-@ fiction super@@ production .
combination with gender
the plan drawn up by the &apos; exotic &apos; expert in &quot; T@@ ep@@ i Men@@ er@@ i required the collaboration of Hollywood .
for the lie to appear truthful , the film project was written in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , the fictitious production society even had a real office .
details of the operation were held in secret for a long time to come , the film has been made from the memories of Tony Saberi .
the Afghanistan film is a unique combination of a number of genders .
on the one hand , a realistic political seller ; on the other , a so @-@ called &quot; catch @-@ up , &quot; the history of an episode that went well , a deception ( an example may be the series Amazon E@@ le@@ see ) .
in the film , the mood is combined , with a well @-@ documented volcano in Tehran , in the sequence of credits , which is emblematic of the days of events , which were translated in the same way in the film ; there are not many differences in this respect .
on the other , the typical scenes of a somewhat lighter Hollywood , marked by irony and a slight exaggeration .
and , moreover , scenes from the CIA and other institutions : men , who analyse the situation at the negotiating table , in the corridors of office , by telephone ...
he has managed to restart his career in an excellent way .
the actor , which had been ridiculed , has become a respectable director and its way of acting is no longer the target for meaningless comments .
the third way to do this is to make the third small @-@ scale luxury , after &quot; small Go@@ ts , farewell &quot; ( 2007 ) , and the th@@ ri@@ ler The &quot; The T@@ ow@@ n , &quot; the city of thieves . &quot; ( 2010 ) .
at the same time , it is the first hidden film in which action is not taking place in the city of Boston , where it was raised .
likewise , the sensitivity of gathering the atmosphere of the site was a feature that placed former film managers above Hollywood standards .
and after all , he is proof of this in Ar@@ go , where Tehran is &quot; wheel &quot; in Canada .
the film &apos;s best scenes are taking place in the streets , in the rebuilding of truthful events , and the introductory sequence of the embassy is impressive in terms of its optical capacity , which , at the same time , conveys the emotion of confusion and lack of foresight that arises when history takes a step forward somewhere .
he and his collaborators have a similar effect on the fictitious scenes ( the impersonal team in Tehran &apos;s bazaar ) .
too far too many action
the director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the film sense of the most intriguing scenes .
and I find it quite good , sometimes you add something to the reality : here it is not so elegant ( the scene in which the crisis looms in Tehran &apos;s airport , the diversion of an appeal to America and the rampant search behind its track become madness ) .
Ar@@ go &apos;s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places .
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Borloo have a very nice role as Hollywood collaborators , even though their characters deserved more space and are not much less , the only ones in this film .
for these reasons , the Afghanistan film loses a bit of dramatic swing , but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest , assessing its realisation , and the re @-@ shaped of a be@@ ren@@ er that cries out to the 1970 &quot; s .
but that will collapse , that will be difficult .
as a reminder of a real history and as a test of how exaggerated the notions of All @-@ the @-@ presence and endless science of secret services can be , it is enough .
rules in the field of globalisation , bananas , and circus
the www.@@ ban@@ k@@ ni@@ p@@ j@@ k@@ y@@ .com servant , who presents a survey every year on the most absurd bank charges , has now decided to announce the competition on &quot; the EU &apos;s more absurd regulation or ideas in the workshop of the EU . &quot;
&quot; we came to us after the latest event , the EU plans to adopt a 40 % quota of women in positions of leadership in Europe &apos;s big companies , &quot; explained the organizing of the survey , P@@ rem@@ as@@ o Patri@@ ek N@@ ach@@ er .
the nominated absurdity is , for example , the European Court &apos;s recent decision to unify insurance policies between men and women .
so far , women have benefited from better prices in living insurance because they are objectively a lower risk .
&quot; other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people by the end of this year . &quot;
the election will take place at the end of February 2013 , &quot; Mr N@@ ach@@ er reported .
among the controversial EU regulations is , for example , the compulsory addition of bio@@ components to fuel which , as a result , damages the environment ; another ban is the use of all life &apos;s mercury meters only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or directive the size of hens , which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year .
there has been criticism of the factual ban on the use of &apos; butter as a &apos; or withdrawal from the classical light bulbs of shops .
a quality banana must have a length of 14 centimetres .
the Union apparatus takes such decisions often under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby , whose petitions in Brussels are usually advocated by some state or group of states ( the Czech Republic , even with the threat of veto , claim its banks &quot; requirements ) .
the interests of lobbying were behind the call , for example , that higher @-@ quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimetres in the EU , and could not present &quot; abnormal cure . &quot;
the European Commission was defended by saying that this only seeks to harmonise the non @-@ homogen@@ ised national rules to date , which only complicated their marketing .
the rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU , despite opposition from some states , have been watered down on the grounds that the existing directive entails waste of foodstuffs .
the candidate to win the survey could be the EU &apos;s prescription last year , according to which it is compulsory for low @-@ 8 @-@ year @-@ free world crises to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflict them without the supervision of an adult .
the EU referred here to an American study according to which , when we talk of toys , globalisation is the main cause of child death by suffocation .
similarly , a similar restriction applicable to the use of permanent slaughter by children up to 14 years .
a curious situation in our country is born .
just as absurd is the regulation on European officials : anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia , so as not to upset Greece &apos;s sensitivity , it must be said that it is FYROM ( the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) .
with the association of laissez @-@ faire liberal economists , there is a few absurd proposals , including the EU &apos;s limitation on the volume of food provision in the territory of a Member State , that is , in conjunction with the association of laissez @-@ faire liberal economists .
the EU determined the maximum volumes of food supply that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU .
then the Czech Republic exceeded , for example , the volume set for mushrooms in keeping , which was a threat of substantial fine .
it was also interested in the organisers of the survey that they would pay those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application for subsidies .
such ideas did not arise in Brussels , but in Prague .
&quot; we are at a disadvantage by not having a sea .
we asked the European Union for compensation , &quot; declared in the autumn of 2004 the Agriculture Minister of agriculture , Jar@@ os@@ ann@@ er@@ as ( Č@@ IS ) .
he was arguing that in our country there was a lot of cereals and , as a result of so @-@ called intervention purchases , the state had the full stores and had to be exported .
according to the figures , given that the Czech Republic is far from sea ports , the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros .
in the end , the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organised a public competition for the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea .
the subsidy to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for local development , led by Minister of the Ne@@ i@@ š@@ u@@ š@@ ester ( US @-@ D@@ U ) , which is aimed specifically at the drafting of subsidies from Brussels .
EU : rare prescriptions are an exception .
the Member States &apos; guidelines are often the target of criticism , the EU &apos;s efforts on regulations , and more effective functioning and development throughout the Union are , according to various experts , better worthy of recognition .
according to the experts , the most serious problem is , for example , the collection of EU subsidies for projects which have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration , but which the Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations .
the Czechs are also sensitive , in the same way as other countries of the Union , to the fight for the right to designation of origin of their traditional products , even though our country has not always been victorious .
the Czechs , after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians , have successfully defended the designation of origin of O@@ lo@@ ac@@ ac@@ ac@@ ling , but they had to change the name to national rum , whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century , and it went to be called &quot; tu@@ z@@ es@@ z@@ em@@ ul@@ o . &quot;
only products produced from sugar cane @-@ free can be called rum , but not those facts from sugar beet .
in the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU , together with the qu@@ ic@@ ine , which is known throughout the world , the quagmire of the German town Liikanen or Parma ham , the greyhounds of Karelia and Varosha are already , for example , the car@@ ho@@ z and T@@ iz scoreboard , and even the variety of hops of Kris@@ is@@ ec .
as the EU &apos;s Adriatic , they will be able to be proud of the bread of j@@ en@@ en@@ gi@@ b of Par@@ hesitate , and of the guns of Ho@@ ł@@ as@@ as@@ an@@ š@@ k@@ on@@ o@@ š@@ í .
people want the republic to be saved , but I am an amateur , they claim that they are Ay@@ am@@ a .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Senator , how happened to the elections for President ?
it is not a question of being a senator or president .
if in our country it was all good , then it would not be my candidacy .
however , I can no longer tolerate the fact that in the last 20 years in our country , the thieves go unpunished , the taxes and the retirement age are being increased .
he had no ambitions to be political .
when I see something that I do not like , I try to make a solution to change it .
since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent , the only possibility I have to change things is to stand as a senator or president .
the Senate has already arrived , but it has soon been put on the way to the presidency .
is it not turning its back on those people who voted for it ?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections .
I know later that if he was elected a senator , I would be in a position to join the presidency .
but my aim is not the role ; the function is the tool with which I can realise my own ideas .
that is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate .
the problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticise in the bar or front of television , but that we are trampling on anyone who wants to start a change .
this is in the middle of the media , which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie .
I am told that I have robbed journalists , or that I have been an adviser to Ji@@ iz Par@@ ou@@ j@@ k .
we are going to talk about your ideas .
it is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theories and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the ownership declaration above 20 million .
this must change the law .
as president , he does not have this competence , and only the Senate can propose laws .
how do you want to resolve it ?
as a citizen , I have been part of a lobby for the guidance industry to be recognised as self @-@ employed , and we have achieved this .
the problem is political : if someone arrives with a good proposal , whether on the right or left @-@ wing basis , it is rejected for purpose , and this affects citizens .
as an independent candidate , I have a greater potential for obtaining the support of all the parliamentary groups .
without ring @-@ fencing or party dogma , I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and to implement it .
is a right @-@ wing or left @-@ wing man considered rather well ?
from the Czech point of view , I have the impression that people feel me to be more left @-@ wing .
it is not important to me , whether it is a bit of the left or a little right .
what matters to me is that we should move forward .
I do not mind if someone is right or left , I want to unite people .
I always strongly support any good solution , regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KONVER or the SDGs , and I will , in the same way , be against bad ideas .
he is a joke when he says that he is populist .
but is he not demonstrating what he says ?
when a business plan for the company is created , you also have certain objectives and ideals .
and you try to get them right .
there are those who call it populism , but all the proposals that I speak about are already working in the world or known experts talk about them .
but , without the support of Parliament , there are only slogans left .
and it cannot survive in long @-@ term policy .
or do you believe that if people are addressed and talk to them , they will , for example , achieve criminal and financial liability ?
I have no other choice .
convincing politicians , journalists and civil society to try and take them from me to achieve this .
if he were elected president , there would be no problem in organising a direct television broadcasting in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimise the state &apos;s criminal and financial responsibility , officials , judges , and government prosecutors .
and , possibly , they would have to be told why they do not want it .
if there is a strong character pointing to disputes , pressure can be put on the political scene .
take the direct election of the president , who has been an achievement of public pressure .
at the same time , I say that I am a fan , I am neither a genius nor an intellectual .
for my own thoughts and ideals , I seek allies .
I have just begun in politics and I try to get the greatest possible support for my programme .
I try to get things moving myself , but if it does not go well , I will leave it in six years &apos; time , and I will come back to the private sector .
it sounds a bit like the Czech Republic is saving the Czech Republic .
I am no saving .
I know that I do not do anything , that is why I have visited a number of well @-@ known personalities , in case they were encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate .
I was going to Rad@@ im Janjaweed , but he refused because he had a great deal of work .
for my part , I have at least supported the research journalist J@@ ana L@@ ana shrinking , which brought to light the fraud involving light oils of heating .
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied , now I am in the balance .
sixty per cent of the population did not go to the polls , and those who did so voted for the establishment .
in the Senate we are two of the independent sectors .
people chose the Senate , so it will be difficult to achieve change .
I will , however , defend my own ideas , such as the direct choice of mayors or governors .
is he considering forming his own party ?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time to do that , to check the good past in each of the potential members of the party , nor do I have any money .
I have no money for the presidency campaign , and in my own transparent account there are only 20 000 000 .
is it not money ?
it speaks of property declarations , how is it ?
I believe that I am privately owned by about 60 million .
in Prague , I have an area valued at 25 million , a floor estimated to be 10 million , another 10 million , a collection of works of art with a value of ten million , a Martin of around 3.5 million and a half @-@ million and a hundred million sheep valued by a million , and in that , I have a couple of millions .
by the way , I have a Martin Mr Martin because I was a dream of young people , and I always liked James Bonner , who led this car , was a gift to women and , at the same time , fought against injustice and injustice .
does Martin lead , his property is valued at 60 million and does he not have money for the campaign ?
you say that you want to change the republic but you do not want to put too much money from you .
it is not very convincing .
I do not have 15 million for the campaign .
do I have to borrow ?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign .
the fact that it has no sponsor shows that there is not much interest in my programme .
and I do not have the obligation to pay the money for my pocket .
the campaign costs cover in essence what I will receive in a senator &apos;s salary .
but he could not live with it , for example , he could not pay my son the English school , costing $ 30 000 .
if I would just like to make money , then I would not be present as a candidate .
so will you continue with your business to be able to live ?
did he not say before he was going to leave this activity ?
this has nothing to do with a higher salary .
as I have promised , I have partly left my activities .
for example , the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute in the spring .
the people would like to see the Sam@@ ari@@ a to save the republic .
but I also need to live up to something .
how often do you live to earn a month as an entrepreneur ?
between 200 000 and 400 000 , which I am still winning .
if he were president , he would leave business .
you can look at the whole interview in the Saturday de Rivera edition .
the S@@ V@@ D@@ V architecture study shows that the real adventures are not only on the head - in the example of the library of Car@@ j@@ ken@@ ri@@ is@@ o , and the recently completed &quot; book mountains &quot; - 2 photos .
&quot; I believe that the building is fun , it has a prospective side , and at last there is something interesting to see , and that is , the building says Li@@ ar@@ te Ver@@ ha@@ i@@ g , a cross @-@ street cross @-@ border .
and St@@ fan Br@@ c , a technical IT system in a big business near the library , points : &quot; in addition , the building is beautiful . &quot;
but I wonder why we need a library today .
we all have the Internet , electronically and electronic books .
no one will be happy to take part in such fashionable libraries , is it not ?
Car@@ j@@ Kenyans , a town in the sand on the gates of Rotterdam , which is hardly worth a sorry visit , holds the dubious honour of having risen with a record to forget .
the population of 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands .
in order to counter this disgraceful situation , it was decided a few years ago to make a certain contribution to general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges which are represented on euro notes in the form of decent @-@ armed mini @-@ troops .
the success of the educational offensive was limited .
and it was as political leaders decided that there was only one possibility for improving statistics : a library had to be built !
put a whole master in the art study M@@ V@@ R@@ V , the Dutch architecture study M@@ V@@ R@@ V , on the art of bars and on @-@ board buildings , which was both cynical and quiet , and the competition was presented in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face .
and while the jury was perplexed around them and a nail on the shoulders , Ma@@ as found book @-@ of @-@ size books to form a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words : &quot; dear fellow citizens :
this is the case , my proposal for the books of Car@@ j@@ burg , the so @-@ called &apos; Bo@@ k@@ enberg &apos; .
nine years later , the mountain of EUR 30 million is being lifted out .
this is part of the revitalisation project , which is completed with an underground parking , a supermarket , a post office and a couple of housing and housing buildings .
at the beginning of November , the book mountain was awarded with the second &apos; B@@ est Li@@ t@@ ary of 2012 &apos; prize .
in addition , the project is also nominated to &quot; Du@@ t@@ ch National W@@ ard 2012 . &quot;
in this way , the small , devoid city of history , which to date had nothing more to offer than a post @-@ modern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly municipality behind whose white façade a milk plant would be more likely than a coal @-@ fired power station , now with a work of contemporary architecture .
but , above all , Sp@@ j@@ Faso now has the first public cultural building in its history .
the Long Way to the book
the first impression is that we are talking about a book paradise , on the basis of a taste .
well , it is true that there is a lift that we are transported just to the heart of this mountain m@@ as@@ o , but the real @-@ mindedness of space and reading is not using it , but rather that we prefer to be merged with their specialities to each step from their escalation to the top .
the inner interior is bright and easy to meet with sight , the brick land and the fine @-@ sounding waves unequivocally support the public status of the library .
the urban environment is perfect .
at the same time , the banks of the park , dogs , and boys , and girls , can be seen to play football .
and for all books , books and more books .
&quot; normally the book shelves are ready throughout the façade , and in the center , there is a huge dark chamber that is usually a bit uncomfortable and un@@ personal , &quot; St@@ and M@@ as .
what we have done is to put the classic space configuration on the head and get the internal reading area from outside .
the home of the mountain is well exploited : in the middle of the offices , the Internet library , the chess club , the environmental education centre and the maintenance room .
there is a special need for the black shelves , which are taking on board roles , as they are , and I would like to say that I would like to stand up to you at the same time .
eyes , tact , and skin are strangers .
even the architects and civilian engineers more up @-@ to @-@ day when they hear about this unknown material .
&quot; we wanted to work on recycled materials , &quot; we explain to us the head of the project in the town of Car@@ j@@ Faso .
and that is how one day , in a farm farm , we are faced with the proper by @-@ product from agriculture .
for many years now , in the Netherlands , a plastic tissue of scarce mm is used as a basis for dealing with crop roots .
it is cheap and efficient material .
there are two stations in which there are two stations , and then it is missing .
for the library , this tissue was on the press , for the first time in such quantities , to reach four centimetres of four centimetres .
with heat and pressure , the so @-@ called agricultural plastic ( K@@ L@@ P ) changes colour and turns into obscure , homogenous , and resilient material that smacks of a new car mix and a sports bicycle .
in the wake of 105 fatalities , the mountains are at the top .
at the end of this continual route of almost 500 metres around the mountain , the reward awaits us : from the coffee shop there is not only a fantastic view of the city , but in it there can also be of a very beautiful Dutch @-@ oriented , and their bloggers in huge planets .
they create a pleasant environment that maintains the right skies for this mountain of literature .
donate to a new soul
&quot; even if it is to be believed , given its large wetlands , this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology , &quot; he points out .
the heating and cooling needed are obtained from geothermal energy .
although the book mountain is located under a huge glass pyramid , even in the darkest days of the sun , the sun is only conspicuous by a few hours .
the huge timber boats that are concentrated in cross @-@ border to the glass façade serve to give a shadow and absorb most of the sun &apos;s rays .
this creates a comfortable internal climate .
the rest is something of the automatic shots .
de fan Br@@ common , the information @-@ sharing in the information technology sector , has already dared to put the foot in the new library .
and Li@@ ar@@ te Ver@@ ha@@ g has also been there .
similarly , the traditional Chinese medical teacher C@@ n@@ n@@ n@@ zer has visited the library : he describes the &quot; Bo@@ k@@ enberg &quot; as the &quot; late soul &quot; of Car@@ j@@ burg .
the reason is that , on the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago , all the people in the city were invited to donate a book of their private collection .
this is the way to fill , for the time being , a library of a library that does not yet have its full file ; it currently has 70 000 copies .
the concept has been profound .
the shelves are full of them .
&quot; there is nothing worse than an empty media library , &quot; says the Win@@ and Ma@@ as architect .
&quot; I believe that thanks to our initiative now all inhabitants have a certain link with this building .
you all know that your book is part of the library .
but it is only there to laugh .
in this way , the M@@ V@@ R@@ V study has achieved a great deal of success in that discipline that is known to be known as the &apos; creation of an identity &apos; in the specialised river clothing .
the town of Car@@ j@@ Toubon has written a piece in the history of literature .
regardless of how young and imbued with it is that it can be .
at last , a starting point for shaping their identity .
Abenomics , &quot; The Germans should play a more prominent role . &quot;
Germany has abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine .
according to Stephen Szent , an expert in US relations , this puts Berlin in a rather difficult diplomatic position .
Cambridge : at the beginning of the week , Germany said that I would vote against the proposal to give the Palestinian territories the status of observer state of the United Nations .
ultimately , however , Berlin abstained .
why ?
I am sure Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
now , because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel , Germany must be careful .
at the same time , however , I believe that it does not support the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel .
during the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany also abstained when it was a matter of establishing a flight ban zone .
this was finally declared by NATO .
is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake ?
yes , that is .
this is due to the fact that its foreign policy is being redirected at the moment , moving away from a policy that is , as it were , led by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy .
what makes things even worse is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy .
so Germans are at a crossroads .
they are expected to play a more independent role , but they are not used to doing so .
I think they are still looking at what their role will be , but they have already begun the road to a &quot; normal &quot; foreign policy .
a foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain .
what does &quot; normal &quot; foreign policy in particular mean ?
it is a policy which , when it comes to national interests , is prepared to defend positions other than those of the United States or its European partners .
I believe that German foreign policy has a strong motivation in economic policy , namely exports and its relations with certain regions , such as Russia , China or the Middle East .
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers , and that is why Germany must protect its interests .
are these economic interests influenced by the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the UN vote ?
on the one hand , Germany has large markets in the Middle East , especially in the Gulf .
that is why it must be careful and not alienated from Arab public opinion , or from Arab elites .
that is important , of course .
but I would not think so much important because it is not a one @-@ sided relationship .
they do , however , play a key role in the German considerations .
has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by refusing to vote in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine ?
I believe that in Europe , and even in the United States , the German position has a huge degree of understanding .
for this reason , I do not believe that there has been such a dramatic break as in the case of Libya .
perhaps Germany has succeeded in gaining a degree of respect .
after all , all this has done nothing but show that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account .
there are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative .
in contrast , the US has been clearly in favour of a veto .
there is a disparity of views between the US and many European nations ?
there have always been such disparities as a result of American domestic policy .
I believe that the Obama administration is showing a great deal of understanding for the European position .
but , because of the political situation in this House , it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public .
I believe that the real disparity of opinions does not really have the size that is given to it .
if we look at relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu , Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy that he develops .
is Germany difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States , on the one hand , with the position of its main partners in the EU , on the other ?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for Germans .
it would , of course , be a bit easier for Germans if there were a consistent and homogeneous European policy , but that is not the case .
therefore , they do not have the chance to be part of a higher body , but they must take things forward from their own position .
that is precisely what they are doing now with the euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position .
that , of course , is not easy for Germany , either simply because of the relationship that it holds with Israel .
this has always been a difficult subject .
but I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure .
does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor , and does Germany really want to play a leading role ?
or is it still difficult for him to accept that leadership ?
Germany has not been used yet , it is always uncomfortable , and , for obvious reasons , the country is still struggling to play a greater role .
if we look at the euro crisis , for example , we see that , whenever Germany stands as a major player , some anti @-@ German sentiments are neglected .
this is not easy for Germans .
this is an old problem , and it is that nobody wants to be surrounded by enemies .
seen in this way , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US .
it must be receptive to the different neighbours and opinions , and that is not easy .
the influence of the US in European policy is growing more and more , but the EU does not cover that vacuum at the moment , who will then be ?
the Germans will have no choice but to play a more central role .
even if they do not like , if they do not like it , or if they do make them an even more unpopular people , c &apos; est the v@@ e !

&quot; protection of brands &quot; in China : when P@@ ma and Ar@@ man@@ is suddenly become Chinese marks
Ar@@ man@@ i is a well @-@ known world @-@ level brand , R@@ al@@ er@@ h St@@ en , as well .
but what is Ar@@ man@@ i Polo ?
after that name there is a officially registered name in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies .
however , it enjoys protection as long as the real stars do not present a demand .
and even then it is not clear that you are going to be right .
&quot; foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China , &quot; points Thomas Patten &apos;s lawyer , Taylor W@@ es@@ ar , who is specialised in breaches of protection rights in the Far East .
a new case comes to my table every week .
neutr@@ tors simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their brands .
in this way , Go@@ ci becomes L@@ u @-@ G@@ ci and instead of Pro@@ a &apos;s registered .
German companies are also legally copied in the same way , as has happened to the sports manufacturer P@@ ma .
Car@@ t@@ lo@@ ch opens a drawer in which he has seats in the Beijing marks office .
on 14 September 2010 , a Chinese company requested to record the Z@@ eg@@ na DF P@@ ma P@@ ma , an artificial name that also served as a fashion home Er@@ ra@@ do Z@@ eg@@ na .
that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known .
in large cities , there are large stores of various plants dedicated solely to the sale of counterfeiting .
however , the cases of Petitions are of a different nature , for the purpose of their customers is to fight against the fact that the brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name which is already registered elsewhere .
the Chinese call it &quot; B@@ g M@@ ing PA@@ I &quot; or marking .
the word comes from the Chinese term , &quot; B@@ g D@@ uan , &quot;
it refers to women who have &apos; fish &apos; to a rich man .
the Chinese authorities do not feel guilty .
&quot; it is bad for business , you have to fight that , &quot; it requires Patent t@@ lo@@ ch .
&quot; the mark is water , the monopoly position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous . &quot;
the financial losses and the procedural coasts of the sectors concerned are millions , especially in the case of luxury @-@ prone products .
according to data from the C@@ SA market analysis company , with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year , China is , in size , the third luxury goods market and growing pace .
however , it is a difficult thing to achieve the annulment of dubious collections in the register of trademarks , and it is a great deal of money .
the processes can be extended to nine years , and the result is uncertain .
Cu@@ t@@ lo@@ ch speaks of cases where the court has dismissed a demand because it has passed so long that the purpose of demand has already become a &apos; market reality &apos; .
&quot; if the complainant is bad luck , perhaps he might even have to pay money for the ro@@ it@@ ator because the process has damaged China &apos;s brand of China , &quot; Mr Posselt points out .
sometimes this is the law of the jungle .
some of the most well @-@ known cases have to do with graphic elements .
in 2009 , Da@@ im@@ ler @-@ Ben@@ z lost a case against the machine of construction machinery manufacturers , and the company that has recently been absorbed by the German of the concrete bomb bomb Putin .
that is why , today , the Chinese can continue to use a brand very similar to Mercedes &apos;s star .
Volvo &apos;s buyer , Ge@@ el@@ y , used the principle to be a blank and blue logo that reminded BMW ; the matter was dealt with in the courts and Ge@@ el@@ er and had to be amended .
in China , the manufacturer of clothing clothing has lost its use in Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo was a crocodile judge looking in the opposite direction to the original .
the Chinese authorities do not feel guilty .
the A marking office in Beijing recognises that in 2010 , difficulties had occurred due to the shortage of equipment and staffing .
last year , however , &quot; the emergency labor situation returned to normal . &quot;
in this way , the number of non @-@ processing complaints processes has fallen by 22 % .
almost 5@@ 7,000 of these cases were resolved , 75 % more than the previous year .
however , 8@@ 500 complaints still remain to be resolved .
combating this costs a lot of money .
as usual in China , the figures are striking .
last year , the CTBT registered over 1.4 million demand protection applications , almost one @-@ third more than in 2010 .
this would be a new record and means that China will lead the 10th year for the list of new entries worldwide , as the mark office points out .
this seems to be the case with the number of good logists , which amounts to 5.5 million in total .
in 2011 , $ 1.8 billion was paid out in terms of rights .
in other words , this means that on average each registration costs EUR 1.@@ 280 or 160 .
combating this costs a lot of money , as the case of the German family company Fre@@ ud@@ enberg demonstrates .
for more than seven years , the ruling group has been fighting against a Chinese im@@ st@@ tor against a court .
while the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts ,
it has succeeded in ensuring that Chinese rights are secured over the Fre@@ ud@@ enberg mark .
&quot; we ourselves have caused this situation for ourselves , because in Germany the names are not protected , &quot; he points out that she points to Han@@ not W@@ o@@ z@@ ler , President , and Deputy Minister of Fre@@ ud@@ g Ch@@ ac@@ ic S@@ ud@@ er@@ ans in Munich .
the S@@ O brands , too , dismissed the municipalities &quot; appeal .
the two subsequent offices have given the reason to Parmalat , but the opposite side continues to fight at the moment .
there has to be a great deal of care to be taken .
the case has now been reached at the gates of the High Court of Justice , where there is still to be a resolution .
W@@ ul@@ z@@ ler hopes to be able to resolve the matter positively and praise the professionalism of the courts .
however , he also states that &apos; the procedure is extremely costly , both in terms of money and in terms of time &apos; .
it is difficult to estimate the internal costs ; the business file has had to review cases of up to 100 years old so that it can provide evidence .
five years ago , Fre@@ ud@@ enberg offered the opposite part of a &quot; sum of six figures in euros &quot; with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement , but it did not succeed .
&quot; this shows how much we care about it , &quot; he points to W@@ uc@@ z@@ ler .
the dangers facing the Far East are even threatening to affect Europe ,
specifically , the rights of non @-@ protected brands are guaranteed there .
thus , a Chinese manufacturer tried to register Fre@@ res@@ enberg for shoes and skin products in Germany .
the group has long abandoned this trade area , but it managed to prevent registration .
&quot; you have to be very careful , &quot; you claim to be .
he and the lawyer , Mr Mulder , recommend that the German companies be extremely cautious in doing business with China .
it is not enough to rely on international brand rights legislation , but to rely on what needs to be done , including in China for everything that can be eligible for protection , &quot; as W@@ uc@@ z@@ ler points out .
otherwise , the subject may be far more expensive than a simple register .
indeed , in the event that Fre@@ ud@@ enberg lost the latest assault on his particular battle , then he would have to pay the opposite of the licence rights by his own name , as he explains the W@@ o@@ z@@ ler side .
that , or in the area in question , would be expelled from the market .
world of the fight against AIDS : dance , sing , help .
in Su@@ el@@ berg the chorus of P@@ bon@@ y@@ a , and the AIDS orphans are welcomed in Swaziland .
the story of a link capable of overcoming much more than 8@@ 33 kilometres of distance .
first of all , one begins with the dance : co@@ ho@@ b@@ o@@ os , p@@ on@@ c@@ on@@ c@@ tics , hair @-@ looking shoes and mo@@ v@@ els are looking for a touch on the soil of bar , and they find it quickly .
two , three , four .
only then are the voices of the winners - a low , printed , and a half @-@ baked - &quot; voices slow to be raised ) , beaten , hampered , and kept by one another .
and Fi@@ te Hope , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old director , is threatening to get almost out of his boxes in trying to put his house in order with his bold and soft gestures .
it is Monday evening , and in the music hall of the Su@@ el@@ am@@ i Medical Institute , the Gl@@ al@@ bon@@ am@@ i chorus is a new song .
they have also arrived at the 50 and 19 years old , from 23 to 69 years , from the human gene to the master &apos;s house .
&quot; O@@ m &apos;@@ O@@ ani &quot; is not an easy piece , every voice of the chorus has a different text , and in a barely known foreign language : the z@@ ul@@ u , a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique , and parts of Swaziland .
aid for self @-@ help
according to an estimate by UN@@ AIDS , the United Nations programme for the fight against AIDS , around the world there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus .
three 3.5 million of them live in southern Africa .
in Swaziland , there are 2@@ 45 000 AIDS orphans .
more than 40 % of the population is already HIV @-@ positive .
the People &apos;s Partnership for Africa has found in Germany for the people of E@@ si@@ t@@ sk@@ o &apos;s 180 AIDS orphans .
seventy them attend secondary school .
for 15 or 20 euros a month , a child can be deposited .
this contribution will cover school enrollment , uniform and guarantee a warm food a day in the Go@@ te Center .
big @-@ one @-@ off @-@ up means in z@@ ul@@ o &apos; tales of stories &apos; or &apos; pan @-@ regional &apos; .
no one is able to speak in this Chamber with a good deal of talking about this black language , but you are aware of it .
for ten years now , the chorus has been a chorus of songs in this soft foreign language , which sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin : southern Africa .
to 8 7@@ 33 kilometres of distance from Ash@@ el@@ berg , in the north @-@ west of the Kingdom of Swaziland , there is a people called E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ av@@ i , which depends on the voices of this German chorus .
40 % is infected .
approximately 2 000 people live there , some of them still simply a lot of mud and straw , a large number of them are children .
more than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS .
E@@ si@@ t@@ eg@@ i is a small example of what is affecting Swaziland : the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy around the world , according to UNICEF .
the population does not look favourably on circumcision , a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion .
more than 40 % of Swaziland &apos;s inhabitants are carriers of the immune virus , and dying with a little more than thirty years has become commonplace .
for a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 , the chorus discovered this troubled population , but what they saw in the streets was many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents , but the main thing : food , clothes , and training .
without a school title , the possibilities in a poor country are more than few .
initially , it was only the special commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to be out to school and to enjoy warm food a day , for a few euros .
a year later , however , the chorus founded the &quot; People &apos;s Day for Africa &quot; that has since been professionally occupied by AIDS orphans at E@@ si@@ j@@ ay@@ i .
action of sexual transmission infections
what are the main sexually transmitted diseases ?
of the bacterial @-@ origin ETS , there is the kind of s@@ ang@@ in@@ is , cries , and ag@@ or@@ Area .
the most commonly rich ETS is AIDS , the human @-@ to@@ m@@ ity virus , genital min@@ tions , or hepatitis .
needles and Sar@@ na are among the parasites transmitted by parasites .
what are the main groups concerned ?
bro@@ y@@ hy@@ is and the hanging are more often taken in men who have sexual relations with other men .
the Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of the cases in Germany which are registered in Germany are based on sexual contact between men .
in the case of heterosexual adults , diseases of the most regular sexual transmission are infections by crying , tri@@ com@@ es , the human @-@ to@@ to@@ to@@ to@@ t@@ oma virus , the candidate ( honour ) , and ag@@ or@@ Area .
the contagion of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively scarce ; however , approximately 20 % of the new HIV infections are registered in this group .
among young people , begging infections are far more common than in other population groups .
according to European surveys , three @-@ quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 @-@ 25 .
in our country , the human race disease is also added to the most commonplace diseases among young people .
how has the number of infections evolved ?
not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to compulsory declaration .
according to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of paedophile infections has doubled its figure of 1.@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 to 3.@@ 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
the number of new HIV infections maintains a downward trend since 2007 .
in 2011 , approximately 2.7 cases were recorded .
that is one tenth less than in the previous year .
what symptoms indicate that this is a clean disease ?
infectious diseases can cause cancer in the genital area , inconvenience to or@@ in@@ ar , flow , corrosive pain , , as well as m@@ as@@ g@@ land or gas .
they often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms , and that is why they are not detected .
how can you protect that ?
condoms can reduce the risk of contagion , but they do not offer 100 % protection .
some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through circuses and physical contact .
for this reason , experts recommend regularly on medical examinations , especially if it is often changed to sexual partners .
if they are diagnosed at an early stage , most ETS can be cured and possible to avoid any belated consequence .
through partnerships , donations , and , last but not least , of the counterpart to the chorus for their actions throughout Germany , they come to raise quite a lot of money .
&quot; in total , we have already sent some EUR 200 000 to E@@ si@@ j@@ iz@@ i , &quot; Al@@ to@@ t@@ ay@@ z , a proud group , Mr Len@@ ar@@ ar@@ z , the leader of the partnership .
in the people themselves Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ am@@ ini , a self @-@ confident woman , with leadership skill , manages the money sent from Germany .
they are concerned that orphans find good accommodation , for example with one of the flies .
&quot; g@@ alists , &quot; as it is called the elderly women in z@@ ul@@ o , are the pillars of the people .
some of them have up to 14 orphans in office , offering them a roof to live and they take care that children go to school every day in time and dress with their uniforms .
those who do not have anyone are left under the protection of Mousavi , a single woman who , like the two craftsmen who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 starving children , perceives a partnership salary .
moreover , &quot; People &apos;s Day &quot; has launched a expensive school , built two barrels of fish , and , in collaboration with the US health organization , it has succeeded in getting many of the people &apos;s inhabitants subjected to an HIV test .
this is not obvious , since , despite the patent of this disease throughout the country , it is not often spoken openly of it .
a King with 14 wives
&quot; AIDS is an absolute taboo , &quot; says An@@ ret@@ te Len@@ ar@@ z , &quot; because it has to do with sexuality . &quot;
something strange in a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
the absolutely absolute monarch of Black Africa , King M@@ le@@ ati III , is known for its rich lifestyle and full @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ life style .
rather , instead of democracy .
this non @-@ accepted way of life is largely responsible for the very rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades .
but it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who go in the country from one side to another and are going on where they go .
according to the Al@@ n@@ ar@@ z , &apos; in any corner , free condoms can be achieved , but they are hardly used .
it is a different culture here , only accept skin @-@ against skin . &quot;
in order to promote cultural exchange , the chorus of bonus travels every two or three years in southern Africa , shouting around songs that talk of gloom , fighting spirit , hope , and confidence in the black race , a songs that many at the more southern end of the African continent still remember the apartheid era .
a bus full of whites who preach songs in a black language ; so much recognition does not only bring an excellent atmosphere and a great deal of joy , but has also succeeded in getting a couple of tears out of some of the other border soldiers .
the trip always leads to E@@ si@@ j@@ a@@ i , where those who visit children have been visiting children .
although this small population barely appears on the maps , it is well known in the River E@@ z@@ ul@@ wi@@ i Valley .
&quot; Action to E@@ si@@ t@@ ay@@ i , there is light there , &quot; people say they are the people of the place .
and , after travelling around 8.@@ 7@@ 33 kilometres in line straight back to Ash@@ el@@ berg to the Ber@@ g@@ k@@ k@@ k@@ tis dog @-@ test rooms full @-@ sounding the move , one realises that it is also possible to shine a light from there .
Per@@ e@@ ger : NASA discovers ice in Mer@@ ev@@ o
the M@@ e@@ ger wave has found evidence of ice in Mer@@ cure .
probably the ice layer has a weight of up to 20 metres .
NASA , the American space agency , has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mer@@ cure .
although we are on the planet closest to the sun , there there is also ice water , as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in the specialised magazine &apos; Science &apos; .
the Mo@@ s@@ ger wave would have found evidence that in the area of the world that is permanently shadow of the shadow , an ice layer has been formed .
it seems that it has at least 30 centimetres and probably even up to 20 metres .
water is supposed to be donated or , with great likelihood , asteroid , that at the time , it was confronted by the Mer@@ cure .
no one links the finding of ice with the possibility of living on the planet , he claims the researcher head of the M@@ e@@ anger , Se@@ an Sol@@ or@@ o .
the temperature in Mer@@ cure can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees .
however , the findings could help to clarify how water and other parts of life have come to other areas of the solar system .
completely unnoticed by the Earth &apos;s inhabitants , sounds , television , and small robots such as P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x are engaged in exploring the depths of the universe .

like P@@ lu@@ t@@ ón , which revolves around the sun just behind the sun , one , according to the new definition of the term published by the International International Union in 2006 , is no &quot; planet . &quot;
this section of an ill @-@ considered image taken by the tel@@ t@@ zer Car@@ t@@ zer shows a &quot; family photograph &quot; in which there are endless generations of stars : older stars are shown as blue spots , although the most difficult thing to recognise is the rose color of &quot; newborn &quot; stars .
this region of star @-@ formation , known as a little romantic by the scientists W@@ 5 , was discovered by the tel@@ t@@ zer tel@@ zer in the constellation of C@@ asi@@ op@@ a , at a distance of 6 500 years .

the combination of a normal photograph and an illegal image gives rise to a dismal spectacular .
this looming star was able to be captured in all its glory for the first time by the ill @-@ equipped detec@@ tors of the tel@@ t@@ zer tel@@ zer .
it is still one of the great uncertainties of astronomical the world that remains .
it is probably a matter of one of the golden ones , which did not disappear without a trace of 4.5 billion years .

our window to the universe : the most important bloggers
it seems that the TV @-@ maker was invented by Hans Li@@ p@@ st@@ he@@ and in 16@@ 08 before Galileo has been used a year later to observe the stars .
since then , it has not stopped growing up and the images that are offering us are increasing in depth .
for 30 years , in particular from 1947 to 1975 , the Hal@@ o @-@ elect Hal@@ o located in the Monitoring Centre in St Di@@ ay was the largest in the world .
your mirror , in the picture , had a five @-@ metre light .
in Arizona , the US is lifted .
it allows us to observe the cliché through two mirrors , each with a 8.4 @-@ metre light .
the interior of the Great T@@ et@@ o Canary Islands located on the island of La Pal@@ ma is enormous - only the mirror has a 10.@@ 4 meters .
the mirror of the South Africa , Afghanistan @-@ designate , has been cut in order to save costs .
despite this , it has reached a slippery slope of approximately 11 metres .
the disadvantage of this more economic construction is that the TV directory has a fixed @-@ rise angle , and so mobility is limited .
the tel@@ ob@@ by @-@ E@@ ber@@ e@@ n @-@ E@@ ber@@ a on the T@@ ars also has a flat @-@ rate angle .
their specificity is their enormous ability to collect light .
despite having a comparatively smaller mirror , such a capacity is comparable to that of the world &apos;s largest in the world .
with the help of the A@@ .@@ A@@ e radius ( Puerto Rico ) researchers can explore the universe in search of un@@ land @-@ based signs of life .

look at the Southern European Monitoring Centre ( ES@@ O ) located in the Chilean An@@ des .
the Ver@@ y L@@ ge T@@ v@@ ar is being put on the table , a television station that is honouring his name .
with a total of four mirrors , this televised web can also defuse the medium @-@ run spectrum .
the ES@@ O will also welcome the so @-@ called E @-@ EL@@ T ( European R@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ y L@@ ge T@@ et@@ ge or the extremely well @-@ elected EU @-@ the @-@ European @-@ Office ) .
its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will be made up of a total of 1 000 spotlight .
until 2018 , it is not expected to be able to take images .
until 2007 , the two tel@@ v@@ os K@@ ut@@ ls located in the Ma@@ u volcano in Ma@@ an K@@ SA were regarded as the largest in the world .
they have two mirrors , each with a 10 @-@ metre light .
the TV screens are part of the Observatory , which , together with them , looks at the sky with the help of the R@@ et@@ um Su@@ bar@@ o and the IR@@ T@@ F .
in Ma@@ an K@@ DP , it is planned to build a new web TV of enormous proportions , with a 30 @-@ metre mirror .
this is an image of how it would be .

the primary mirror of this space directory has a 6.5 metre light .
one of the roles of this web @-@ maker will be to look for the light of the first stars , as trained after the big bang .
researchers are based on the fact that there is ice in the southern pole of Mer@@ cure , too .
however , there is no reliable evidence , since the Cha@@ e@@ anger wave around the planet revolves around the planet in a orbit much closer to the north .
for decades , radar measurements have been aimed at the existence of ice in Mer@@ cure .
thanks to the S@@ le@@ anger ( 2004 ) ( 2004 ) , the first sitting around Mer@@ cure , scientists now have the certainty that this is the case .

the journey through the mountainous region of Tal@@ y@@ h could be described as a ruthless and romantic one .
the mini @-@ bus is progressing with great taste through the wrong road that goes along with Bosnian hills , large @-@ scale rivers and the simple homes of local farmers .
everything is green and high , one might even think it is in the Black Forest .
however , we are in the most southern area of Azerbaijan ; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres .
here , there is a lot of a people who do not know much , apart from the fact that they are perfectly well @-@ rooted in the Valencian and that they are very rich .
our final destination is L@@ ag@@ k .
this small town boasts a perhaps too little architecture designed in the Soviet era , and it does not seem to fit all in a very familiar mountain landscape .
European tourists barely reach this place , because the road from the capital of Azerbaijan , Baku , is too cumbersome .
to travel the 3@@ 23 kilometres that separate both urban centres , it takes eight hours because the road is a one @-@ way .
the staggering wealth of which the country enjoys oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the region .
however , Pilate Y@@ ay@@ ay@@ eva ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ ag@@ k has what needs to be had to become a tourist attraction .
&quot; Baku has been famous in May for the celebration of the Euro @-@ vision Box , and next year we will celebrate the summer of the most elderly people in the world , &quot; he points to Y@@ ay@@ ay@@ eva .
this is the head of the longevity Museum , perhaps the only one in the world .
there is a documented life in eight dozens of the lives of the place which has gone over 100 years of age , with the black and white image as a black and white image .
this is my grandfather , who lived through 120 years .
a son of yours died at the age of 136 .
however , the case of the undisputed star of the museum is sheep her@@ i@@ il@@ ali Ash@@ h@@ ü@@ s@@ ski , who seems to have lived for 168 years .
however , there is no starting @-@ point to be certified .
and if we bear in mind that the documented man has lived for 122 years , it seems that the age of Astana is quite suspicious .
&quot; he was born in the region in 18@@ 05 , and he died in 1973 , &quot; he explains to us , Ahmad ul@@ ay@@ eva .
the man was married three times and had 23 children , who apparently still had time to conceive a daughter more at the age of 136 .
is it wrong then , at its age in a couple of decades , , in a couple of decades , there was a mistake ?
however , R@@ uc@@ t Sch@@ ol@@ z , the management of the Echelon Institute , has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia .
&quot; in some regions of China , Japan , or the Ch@@ za Valley in Pakistan , they also live of high @-@ age people , &quot; claims Sch@@ ol@@ z , &quot; even in Sardinia , there are many older men . &quot;
because of the lack of documentation , it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age , especially since there is no civil register .
every day , in the midst of dried butter .
it is a fact that , in a surprisingly frequent way , the inhabitants of the region around L@@ eli@@ k are usually reaching a biblical age .
there are now 20 people over 100 years of age .
why are so many elderly people here in the south ?
the Montenegrin tourist guide , Far@@ id Mu@@ im@@ z@@ ad@@ h , explains that it is a question of the special genes of the sh@@ y@@ ren@@ ons .
the museum director , Mrs Yade , believes in change that the cause lies in food .
however , from a nutritional point of view , it does not seem logical that it is precisely food @-@ rich food that love meat , love meat , bread and , above all , dairy products , and many of whom , in addition , drink a glass of broken butter on a daily basis is so healthy .
or is it the natural way of life that keeps young people in a natural life ? in Cabinda , a small settlement is not far from the town of L@@ ag@@ k Ru@@ b@@ a Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
its 97 @-@ year @-@ old age is relatively young to be found in these Latin America .
Alex , who claims to have 143 descendants , lives in a simple house of wood that is typical of the whole Caucasus region .
sitting on the ground , I am constantly moving in a great deal of butter .
eight people live under a roof , including one of the children , and a daughter of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , both became grandparents a long time ago .
there are also two small children from one side to another .
in the kitchen , they are preparing for the guests , a tea which serves typical small @-@ scale vessels .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s teeth are white , and are perfectly aligned , and under the headscarf , he hides two long lines of dark weather that his child is proud to discover .
I have always been washing my hair on milk , which is why I have never been left and maintained its colour .
&quot; I have never used the way in which I have never used the way in which he has been used , he says , St@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
the pension is sufficient to live .
he has always eaten only what he produced in his own farm : tomatoes , potatoes , and Go@@ is@@ ant .
I have never , in my life , ever been buying a supermarket .
then you talk to your husband , who was in the army .
the worst was the post @-@ World War II era .
however , it went back to its channel when the &quot; loved father , &quot; He@@ y@@ y@@ ally , took control of the situation .
this type of propaganda sounds strange in the mouths of a larger woman .
in Azerbaijan , however , the cult that is known to the nation @-@ based figure , which runs its country as a dictator , knows no limits .
he remained in power until 2003 , when he gave up his son I@@ ham .
at least the elderly people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is .
the story is that of a monthly pension , a figure with which a number of people can live well , taking account of the situation here .
and perhaps the baby of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva is right : &quot; in our culture the elderly are very respected . &quot;
they live in a large family , are loved , get all the necessary care , and are happy .
as if this was not sufficient reason to stay alive many years ...
in the Constitution , the expression &apos; Human Rights &apos; is lacking .
the revolution has returned to Cairo .
those who compete with each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired .
the future constitution , with sharia as a basis , is very controversial .
the Egyptian President did not go away in the mouth .
&quot; we must overcome the transition .
and that is my responsibility , to the people and to God , &quot; he said in public television .
your speech was directed at the whole people , particularly the Christian Copts , the liberals , enlightened and secular Muslims .
all of them , who have so far been mired in confusing opposition , are afraid .
fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community .
as Mohammed Mur@@ a explains , he almost apologized , he had to cancel temporarily the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own &quot; in order to save the revolution . &quot;
however , neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61 @-@ year @-@ old engineer with a doctoral title granted by the University of California really wants to save .
does it intend to deprive the judiciary of its power ?
indeed , the 2@@ 34 articles , whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 Islamic members at a 15 @-@ hour night meeting , are truly worrying .
as in previous constitutions , it is also said in the draft that the case law is based on the &quot; principles of Islamic law . &quot;
but what does that mean &quot; principles ? &quot;
this was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague wording , as well as the legal margin for manoeuvre that has been raised , to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia law .
this is at least which is suggesting a new added article : on Sharia issues it is obligatory to consult Al @-@ Ash@@ ar University , the most important Islamic institution of the country with a great power in all Sunni Islamism .
that does not have to be the case , but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation - something that - in fact - would result in the in@@ ability of the judiciary .
much of the constitution is open to interpretation
what is also problematic is that it aims to maintain military jurisdiction .
during the Mubarak dictatorship , these courts served to exert severe repression on the opposition .
after the dictator &apos;s fall to 14 000 civilians , they were arrested in military prisons .
as the draft states , the state must protect &quot; the true essence of the Egyptian family &quot; and &quot; promote their morals and values . &quot;
it is such a vague wording in legal terms that , with the help of this article , the state institutions could even control the content of film and literature .
it is , of course , nothing more than censorship .
it is true that no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women .
in other words , another ban bans or slander the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies .
it is not clear , however , what is an offence and how it is to be punished .
just as dubious is the wording that prohibits &apos; offending people &apos; .
is a caricature of the president enough or a joke about a sign ?
the question of interpretation , like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mur@@ if for his signature and , according to his words , &quot; very soon &quot; will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum .
&quot; revolution has returned &quot;
weeks ago , the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists .
ten thousand people met in unusual harmony in the afternoon &apos;s Tahrir Square in Tahrir Square and sworn in the Minutes before it can enter into force .
&quot; the revolution has returned , and we will end up winning &quot; , says Ham@@ din Saberi , who occupies the third place on the lists in the presidential election .
the Nobel Peace Prize and the Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed El @-@ Baradei , declared that the draft of the constitution should be &quot; in the dustbin of history . &quot;
through Twitter , he accused of Rangoon &apos;s followers if he wanted to lead a &quot; coup against democracy . &quot;
&apos;@@ when we call the referendum on your palace and put it back , you say &apos; , you say the opposition will be Sa@@ id .
&quot; we are still not tired , our brothers &quot; blood has not yet been matched , &quot; the Egyptian political opponent of Ch@@ al@@ ed Ali was cited in the Egyptian media .
and several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum , so it would not be considered valid .
&quot; the Koran is our constitution . &quot;
for their part , the well @-@ organised Muslim community called for a counter @-@ fire , if not in Tahrir Square , but after a sentence on the other side of the Nile , to the University of Cairo .
many women covered by a veil and Salaf@@ er &apos;s supporters took part in it to the cry : &quot; the people require the application of divine law . &quot;
they called on Mur@@ if &quot; clean up the country , &quot; while proclaiming : &quot; the Koran is our constitution . &quot;
a struggle for the sovereignty of symbolic Square , where everything began , would have caused a similar situation to that of civil war .
it is quite clear that Mur@@ a supporters did not want to risk that such a thing would happen .
the Muslim brothers claimed that both opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters of the constitution would have expressed their strong and clear views .
the time would now have come to let the people decide at the polls what direction the country should take .
in this sense , the Islamists appear to be guaranteed the majority .
&quot; the expression &apos; Human Rights &apos; does not even appear &apos;
H@@ af@@ z Abu Saad is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and have included all the social forces .
this 48 @-@ year @-@ skilled lawyer on human rights and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization ( E@@ O@@ H@@ R ) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to deal with a trial during Mubarak &apos;s dictatorship .
not because I share his ideology , but because he is indivisible by human rights .
that is why he was beaten , convicted and imprisoned .
&quot; and now the expression &quot; Human Rights &quot; does not even appear in the new constitution , &quot; he regrets in a conversation with the newspaper &quot; W@@ t am Kal@@ n@@ ag . &quot;
the extension of the roles of Mur@@ a to the three powers of the state led this lawyer to resign .
the measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship .
&quot; instead of strengthening civil society , what the president has done is to abolish it , &quot; he is sorry .
however , democracy cannot work without civil society organisations .
he feels abandoned , including by the international community , which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the shores of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension .
this could be turned against him .
a demonstration in Tahrir Square warns : &quot; you are drawing up a monster that you are not going to control . &quot;
the Norwegian ak@@ sk : is the world &apos;s worst @-@ of @-@ the @-@ sea fish ?
Norway &apos;s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not only in Europe but in the world .
is it possible for the country &apos;s success to have any relationship with its greed for extremely bad fish ?
I will take a number of these excessively cured .
they are in the middle of a dirty and dirty football clothes in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football .

the ak@@ si@@ sk is a m@@ uc@@ y to fill in bed , which is left to fill in water during , depending on the evil that you would prefer , up to a year .
as a result of which it is becoming more cold , the Norwegians come into a festival here , in F@@ ag@@ na@@ a , which is devoted to this kind of , so to speak , a par@@ able , as it were .
&quot; crude oil is eaten , and then a glass is used to drink a bl@@ ite of a trip , &quot; says H@@ av@@ ard Hal@@ ti , the city &apos;s shot , which is also what is known as the &quot; R@@ ak@@ sk General , &quot; which is responsible for organising the festival .
on the other hand , we see people eating this fish that is kept in small tablets and drinking significant quantities of drink .
&quot; some people like more of it than the ak@@ sk , &quot; they claim to be H@@ av@@ ard .
drink can kill the smell .
a few pieces .
if you can avoid passing close to the nose , it is not wrong ; it is not quite different from a su@@ hi share that has travelled a few kilometres in bus .
ak@@ sk is a product that comes from a very different era , in which poverty struck Norway , and in which , before cooling , the fish were kept in ice in water and salt in watertight barrels .
later , in the middle of winter , when it is already well @-@ established , it is removed , and , of course , on the ground because of alcohol , it is eaten .
only a generation ago , thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work , and they mostly emigrated to the United States .
currently , the population is increasing rapidly ; more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by the abundance of jobs , high wages and a complete social services system .
a mainstream of the population of Sweden , the old rival , and even far too much richer than Norway , reaches this country to work .
helium is considered to be an important one , a key , though rather bad , part of Norway &apos;s past .
it is among the most expensive plates that can be bought .
but , in fact , everything is expensive : a beer cane , or a m@@ op@@ op@@ ü@@ r@@ te cost the glass of 10 € 14 ( $ 14 ) .
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda , and most Norwegian likes to do so .
here , people are still unwilling to say the name of Anders Bethell , the extreme right @-@ wing racist who has shot and murdered 77 people , including men , women and children .
instead , they refer to the shooting as &apos; the event of 22 July &apos; .
it is hard for the Norwegians to believe that they would be able to commit such cruelty and murder in their peace @-@ keeping country .
after much of Norway &apos;s current wealth , growth has emerged , from the beginning of the 1970 &quot; s , from one of the world &apos;s largest oil and gas industries .
&quot; but oil is not the only reason why it is so good , &quot; he says , Mrs Anna , our shrimp , while he is going to go to the brink of ak@@ it@@ sk , and that , with his long hair @-@ breaking bl@@ am@@ y and his blue @-@ minded hot eyes , he represents the image of Norwegian welfare .
&apos;@@ We are , as you say , prudent people &apos; .
its English , like that of the majority of people in this country , is impeccable .
&quot; we don &apos;t like to boast , we don &apos;t like it . &quot;
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously ; everything , except a small percentage of money from this industry , is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
while everyone squandered money that he did not have in the years that preceded the financial crisis worldwide , Norway kept the purse well closed .
&quot; as long as we can get away in winter and go bust in the summer , we are happy , &quot; she says Anna .
&quot; and eating ak@@ sk , &quot; he adds with a lame ride .
I am in snow queuing up to eat something ; I have had enough ki@@ sk .
now there is no doubt a bit other , but a little bit other , and I would like to know how much I have to know .
but in the night , it turns that wrong fish .
the hotel in which I am an eye is one of the many local people in which the dinner is held by a ki@@ sk dinner in which they vote for the best fish , or perhaps the one that is being put to the test the most .
television has been directly linked to a gift who has been wearing j@@ ari@@ ta and surrounded by ak@@ sk plates .
it seems to be the Euro@@ vision tender .
&apos;@@ What are your comments for the best fish there up in the mountains , Th@@ or @-@ Ju@@ er@@ gen ? &apos;
&quot; here is our score , H@@ av@@ ard . &quot;
there is laughter and applause .
a man falls on the chair , perhaps won over the chair .
or perhaps it is the fish that is all that fish .
Mexico : Enrique Peña Nieto is facing a hard start .
as the incoming President of Mexico , Enrique Peña Nieto , is preparing to take office , the BBC correspondent , W@@ ill G@@ ant , looks at the challenges that the new president and the different expectations of his people will face .
the trafficking in Mexico City is particularly bad today .
in a city which , in the best circumstances , is already in the run @-@ up , has , since Monday , been installed in steel in short , a number of the main roads which lead to the city and which is causing enormous chaos on the roads .
the aim , however , was not to prevent workers from getting to their place of work , but to prevent the demonstrators from coming to the parliament .
on Saturday , Mexico &apos;s new president , Enrique Peña Nieto , will receive the presidential band and will take over the nation &apos;s management .
it faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been making good economic performance during Felipe Calderón &apos;s outgoing government , but the country is mired in a war against the drugs that has already claimed some 60 000 lives in six years .
&quot; my government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence , &quot; Mr Peña Nieto explained at the beginning of this week to US President Barack Obama in the O@@ v@@ a .
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that objective . &quot;
before we go back to the US president , the previous political experience of Mr Peña was as Governor of his homeland , that of Mexico .
a highly populated and rapidly growing state around capital ; views on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move .
a sincere man
for example , the town in the town of Br@@ ay@@ o , for example , is proudly reminded of it .
their residents attribute credit for the growth of tourism in the place and building of infrastructure .
in order to reach the city , it can lead to Mr Peña Nieto &apos;s new roads , which is a huge improvement in relation to agri @-@ agricultural roads , which were recovered .
they can also be seen by their name in the entry of a theological modern and an impressive interactive museum on climate change .
&quot; we trust that he will succeed in making a real and lasting change , &quot; his friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ st@@ Hernández , a member of the party of Mr Peña Nieto &apos;s party , the PRI .
&quot; particularly , in terms of security and economics , we expect an interesting and real change that our country needs . &quot;
after an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power , the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in the year 2000 .
Member Ol@@ would admits that , after 12 years outside of the presidential palace in the p@@ ins , there are many expectations within the party about Enrique Peña Nieto .
it also rejects the rating that the opposition makes of the new president &apos;s lack of substance .
&quot; he is a very sincere , committed , and an excellent vision of the country .
he is a fantastic man of state , and , above all , he is a person who knows to listen . &quot;
yet , on the other side of the state , that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor .
in N@@ z@@ a@@ ai@@ y@@ ot@@ l , also known as N@@ za City , the contrast to the g@@ lo@@ ho@@ g@@ ho@@ stones of Br@@ i@@ o &apos;s Valley could not be greater .
hidden under high highways is , in many ways , a sub @-@ grotesque of Mexico City itself .
and the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban .
at the beginning of this year , military intervention was asked to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious .
in a desert field , located alongside a waste landfill , they have been abandoned in just the last two years the bodies of dozens of murdered women .
more than 1 000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Peña Nieto was the governor , a much higher rate than that of City of City , unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women .
Mr Peña Nieto &apos;s critics say , at best , that he failed to deal with the problem of feminicide while he was in office .
most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye .
in a concrete house , typical of the deteriorating neighbourhood , I@@ in@@ a Bu@@ da needs to make efforts to contain tears while showing photographs of his deceased daughter , Mari@@ ana moon .
according to the official version of the facts , Mari@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 .
his family , however , believes that his couple murdered him .
&quot; when I arrived at home , he seemed as if he had been cleaned by the body , &quot; he remembers Mrs Bu@@ den .
&quot; there were signs that it had been hit and rigour had already appeared . &quot;
while his mother quotes history , a photograph of Mari@@ ana observes from the walls , together with a cross where one word is read : justice .
however , that is exactly what the family says it has been denied .
&quot; I have been treated by the state authorities as if it were an old washing @-@ up , a beating , a complaint .
what they want is for you simply to accept what they say and to the street . &quot;
&apos;@@ But that is not the case when there have been so many irregularities and such negligence &apos; , you say .
the presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years , and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term .
&quot; I hope it is the same kind of president as Governor , &quot; he says , the PRI Member of the PRI in Valle .
however , that is exactly what the families of the victims of Mexico City fear most fear .
law Man@@ ning did not denounce ill @-@ treatment , as the prosecutors &quot; claim .
prosecutors are trying to cope with allegations of abuses by C@@ ley Man@@ ning during his stay in prison .
the trial focuses on Man@@ ning &apos;s period in the Qu@@ anti@@ o military prison in Virginia .
defense wants the case to be dismissed on the grounds that Man@@ ard &apos;s imprisonment was severe .
the army &apos;s soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents .
the prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that the soldier Dmitry Law Man@@ ning , accused of the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the United States , lost multiple opportunities to denounce the ill @-@ treatment that he now claims he suffered as he was under military arrest .
during the interrogation that the public prosecutor made to Man@@ ch in a pre @-@ trial prior to the trial in F@@ T . Me@@ y@@ land , Mar@@ y@@ land , the prosecutor Commander Ash@@ den F@@ in stated that registers of the weekly visits by the unit that he had received for nine months of detention in Qu@@ anti@@ co , Virginia , show no complaint about the treatment that he received .
interrogation , which was carried out in the wake of the defence request to reject the case that his incarceration had been tough and that had already been punished enough , came a day after Man@@ ning had testify that he had thought in suicide as he was arrested .
the army &apos;s intelligence analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq .
later , WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet .
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Man@@ ning is the source of information .
in the light of Friday , F@@ ang@@ ing revised the forms that the officers filled after the visits to Man@@ ning during his arrest in the Qu@@ anti@@ o military prison , where he was imprisoned in the highest @-@ prison regime from July 2010 to April 2011 .
the officers would have asked Man@@ ning questions and noted their responses .
on Friday , he asked about the forms , Man@@ ning recognized that he had described the treatment given to him as &quot; excellent &quot; and the treatment received in the facilities in general as &quot; very professional . &quot;
the forms do not show any denunciation of ill @-@ treatment , despite the fact that the officers asked to Man@@ take directly on the treatment that he received , he said F@@ in .
Mr President , he replied that he had expressed his concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had talked about these problems and had indicated that they would be treated , but that they did not leave these issues on the record .
&apos;@@ There were &apos; no incidents &apos; ( after having talked about problems ) , but this does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problems , &apos; he said , he said .
the Judge , Cor@@ ad@@ el of the Military Army , , also asked Man@@ ard why he had not denounced the treatment he received during his meeting in January 2011 with a council responsible for examining the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier .
De@@ ard responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the &quot; injury prevention &quot; regime that he was in .
the military said that they had put it under that restrictive regime , that a degree is below the level of surveillance for possible suicide , to guarantee their protection and the security of other people .
&quot; I wanted the largest state to know that I was well and ( I wanted ) stop being under injury prevention - to be able to enjoy what , in my view , is a better quality of life , &quot; he said , he said .
D@@ ning himself on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison on the basis of the F@@ anti@@ ba , Virginia , in July 2010 .
he said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost knowledge due to heat .
he said that he would not be allowed to know what was going on or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing .
&quot; my world was reduced not only to the oath of the cage , to that cage , &quot; Mr Man@@ ch explained on Thursday .
&quot; I thought he was going to die in that cage . &quot;
Mr President , he said that , once he went to Qu@@ anti@@ co , he spent the majority of the days in a small cell , at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours , without a company .
De@@ ning said that he was only allowed to have a cushion , a man@@ ta , a cha@@ st@@ in , a bit of clothes , a bit of clothes , and his glasses .
he said that he was trying to move all the time , because he was forbidden to sleep , or even to break down during the day .
Man@@ ning said that he always had a light from outside his eyes , while sleeping .
he said that if viewers could not see the face when the return was going back in the evening , they woke up for the return to return .
Man@@ ard &apos;s lawyer presented a formal complaint about the treatment he received in January 2011 .
De@@ ning was transferred to the military prison of Br@@ ul@@ at@@ z worth in Kansas in April 2011 .
on Friday , the judge asked Man@@ ch on a plea he made in the statement on Thursday that , after being forced to sleep naked in his Qu@@ anti@@ o cell , he was forced on him in his cell @-@ counting cell to remain a toothless foot in the face of the guardians and other prisoners .
Th@@ ning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the man@@ ta during his count .
during the judge &apos;s interrogation on Friday , Man@@ ning said that he would infer from the order in which he gave him the bearer that he should allow himself to fall out of his hand to which he could have been covered , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to leave .
Se@@ ling testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of an attempt to show an official that he did not pose a danger to himself .
Man@@ ning said that he had told the official that he could have used the el@@ ge@@ ary of his domestic clothing or his man@@ ag@@ ors to stay out , but he had not .
&quot; the night had recalled that his cell &apos;s domestic clothing had been withdrawn from his cell that night , his ch@@ traction and his glasses .
your lawyers have the hope that the judge will take at least account of the experiences that he has experienced during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he was convicted in the war council , which is scheduled to start at the beginning of next year .
the defence said that he plans to make Man@@ row guilty of minor crimes and defend other accusations that are considered too extreme .
it is supposed to be resumed this weekend , and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified .
the Pentagon has maintained that Man@@ ning was detained in accordance with the rules for implementing it under full custody in Qu@@ anti@@ co .
charges against Man@@ take include cooperation with the enemy , causing illegally to cause information on the Internet , leakage of information from national defence , and property theft or public registers .
if he is convicted of all charges , he could face life imprisonment .
my Mexican @-@ American Crisis Crisis
he says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunity .
Mexicans tend to criticize those who went ; they say they remember the Mexicans of those difficult times .
the Mexican @-@ American people are told that the Mexican @-@ American people are caught between two worlds .
in a recent trip to Mexico City , there was hardly a drop in the old trip to the immigration area of immigration and was already completely confused .
some posters indicated the way to two queues : one for &quot; D@@ N@@ end@@ ans , &quot; and another for &quot; foreign @-@ exchange . &quot;
I was there for a few seconds , without being sure where I should go .
having grown up in Central California , I have been called &quot; Mexican &quot; throughout my life .
this is ethnic cancer , just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as &apos; Irish &apos; or my friends in New York are describing themselves as &apos; Italian &apos; .
later , I decided for &quot; Mexican @-@ American . &quot;
but this was Mexico .
and , in my grandfather &apos;s homeland , car@@ c@@ graphy or hooligans were not necessary .
it was simply American .
I speak Spanish , well enough to manage me during an interview in this language .
but I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native , and I cannot get away from my American accent .
so I took my American passport and I put me in the queue of foreigners .
I felt at the time of this week that Mexico &apos;s elected president , Enrique Peña Nieto , visited the White House to meet President Obama .
on the agenda of the day , as always with the leaders of these two countries , it was on the agenda : immigration , drugs and trade .
Peña Nieto was eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy as well , one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexican will remain in Mexico as it will venture to go to the United States .
it wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a European @-@ style trade bloc in North America .
moreover , Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico , although he did not give details .
for Mexico , the relationship with the US is complicated and full of bitterness .
probably most Americans will never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory at a gun .
but for Mexicans , who think in centuries , not minutes , the elements that remind them are everywhere .
so , at a time when a United States official says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico , the desperate to hear complaints , both in the press and among the Mexican elite , about how Americans are stealing the sovereignty of their neighbors .
and the children of Ma@@ z@@ z@@ u@@ ma are put on the ground .
and yet , for Mexico , the relationship that is really a challenge to Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican @-@ American people living in the United States .
are we talking about bitterness ?
there is a lot .
in Mexico there are winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not .
the only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles , The V@@ is@@ x , P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x , Denver or Saint Antonio is that , at some point in our brain tree , there was one person , or one person , or the mother or one of the grandparents , who were closed down in Mexico and went to the north .
and most of the time that person was in a certain profile : dark skin , a low level of study , from a poor village , etc .
we are the bottom @-@ up and we are loyal to them .
Mexico is not .
and although we are perhaps living with the American dream , having gone to good schools and had good jobs , we must never lose sight of the fact that what we are living with is that , the American dream , and not the Mexican dream .
sometimes our identity is not clear , but our loyalty is .
it is for the United States .
moreover , we are aware that many of Mexicans from the elite elite do not like .
the feeling is mutual .
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat , and look ahead to us as if we were a lower category that is not Mexican enough .
our Spanish will never be good enough , and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough .
to your mind , our existence is synonymous with failure .
if our families had not failed in Mexico , they would not have gone .
and now we would not find ourselves trapped after this Silk Curtain , living well in the United States but still , as one @-@ off souls .
my wife , who was born in Gu@@ champions and legally in the United States when he was a girl , reminds me of the fact that there is such a mess between Mexicans and the Mexicans and the Mexican @-@ American people , because the former are more robust in who they are and the seconds this is a nuisance .
although it is a citizen of the United States , it sees it as part of the two countries .
in the meantime , many Mexican @-@ American people feel that they are not part of either .
we are delighted to hear the Mexican Tigers of the North Tigers , but also GDP .
you have the best of each country , but you are not rooted in any of them .
in Mexico , you see us as American .
and in the United States we are seen as Mexicans .
now , to complicate matters further , so I have learned during my trip , some Mexican leaders , and some intellectuals , want to connect with the diaspora .
they want the Mexican @-@ American to work as an improvised &quot; ambassadors &quot; of Mexico , representing their interests in the United States .
we would call on our colleagues in America how fantastic it is to visit that country and put pressure on the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico .
yes , of course ...
that is not going to happen .
there is too much bitterness .
and , with wage inequality , rampant corruption , and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country .
I fear that you are going to be left alone with this idea , friends .
it is right .
if some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which they treated Mexico a century and a half ago , they have to accept the fact that some Mexican @-@ Americans are still suffering as their families have been treated far less time .
Save .
let us perhaps be more &quot; Mexicans &quot; than I thought .
the New Middle East
a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a unlikely basis for peace .
can there be one day lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ?
another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain .
in the midst of the useless and regular discussions on who started first , lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed , and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv , Israel &apos;s mainland , and the holy city of Jerusalem .
but , while Israelis and Palestinians appear to be anchored in their old conflict , everything surrounds them in the Middle East is changing .
the Arab Spring has left it all the way like it likes it or not , Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in regional uproar .
perhaps this makes his struggle even more bloody than before .
however , there is reason to think that its lethal deadlock can be kept silent .
a War that is not lost or won .
at first glance , this optimism is currently very difficult to justify .
even if the agreed ceasefire is maintained on 21 November , this week &apos;s clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides .
Hamas leaders , the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw , even though Gaza has received a good beating .
and , despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet , Israel has not been able to end Hamas .
indeed , Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank , the other part of Palestine now ruled by its ruthless rivals of Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction .
moreover , Hamas leaders could conclude that the time is in their favour .
given that Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world , Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships .
Turkey , a burgeoning regional power that had previously been Israel &apos;s closest Muslim ally , has embraced the cause of Hamas , as Qatar , one of the Gulf &apos;s richest and dynamic states , has also done .
Hamas &apos;s former members of Hamas say that the Islamist moon is surrounded by Israel , from Lebanon to the north , where the Syria @-@ led Syrian party @-@ militia , where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist trend could overthrow Bashar Assad , could topple Bashar , where Hamas &apos;s allies are threatening the king .
especially on the southern flank of Israel , the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt , the most populous and most fundamental of the Arab countries , has changed the region &apos;s balance .
Hosni Mubarak , the secular despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years to its collapse in 2011 , did not have far too long for Hamas .
in contrast , the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas &apos;s stars , and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion .
in future diplomatic actions , it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a leading player , which cannot be excluded , not even Israel and the United States .
in the meantime , Israel &apos;s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion .
as far as the military issue is concerned , they have put Hamas in place .
the National anti @-@ missile missile system of Israel has proved its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed .
the Israelis will go back to the rest - for some time .
as for diplomacy , the US is stronger than ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence .
first and foremost , Israel has prospered , especially under Binyamin Netanyahu , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has not had far too many suicide bombers , partly thanks to the barrier @-@ keeping barrier in the West Bank , the main piece of a territory aspiring to become Palestine , and protects the remaining Jewish settlements , even though , according to international law , they are illegal .
Mr Netanyahu , whose Likud party has joined with a group of an even tougher line led by A@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ man , in the run @-@ up to the elections on 22 January , is in a good position .
why would the Palestinians give them a state of their own ?
if they really ruled in the West Bank , would they not shoot rockets as their compatriots in Gaza have done ?
it is better to have them after that wall and give them a good blow if they lead the way .
the hard wing may be imposed , though the Arab Spring could alter its calculations .
although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel , their priority will be to address domestic difficulties .
Israel &apos;s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together .
starting a war with the superpower &apos;s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies .
that the pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something .
the Israelis should also think about the long term .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depriving the Palestinians of their right to self @-@ determination is to create a powder keg that will one day exploit Israel &apos;s occupied territories , just as it exploited a bus in Tel Aviv this week .
repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases .
cross @-@ border missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll .
both sides need a boost from people outside the conflict .
the solution remains what they preach from both sides , the majority of the outside world , and this newspaper : Israel &apos;s two states and Israel &apos;s transfer of territory for security reasons .
hope , small in the short term , is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause .
Egypt , which must begin to curb arms entry into Gaza , together with Turkey and Qatar , is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders , with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem .
the Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join .
this would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status status in the UN .
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table .
during his first term , he failed to present his own peace plan .
again in the White House , he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention .
this is a deplorable vision for the future .
a stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States .
this implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine .
the generic packaging law enters into force in Australia
warnings on smoking risks and parts of the body with diseases that are blowing over a green gun , which are the same for all tobacco brands .
the Australian e @-@ tobacco law , a pioneer in the world , enters into force and replaces trademarks and brands of brands by a packaging of a green wind , a frightening images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies for being children of smoking parents .
with the exception of various health images and warnings , the only difference between the mandatory holidays since Saturday are the names of trademarks , all of which are printed in a small @-@ source source .
it is the most stringent regime in the world applying for packaging .
Australia &apos;s federal government claims that the goal is to deter young people of smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit .
they rely on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the 26 years , there is 99 % chances that he will never .
&quot; you can see that children , even from a very young age , understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand , &quot; said the federal health minister , T@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , by quoting studies that showed , for example , how girls associated the lira with the idea of being a par@@ in .
although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world , and that these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much , other countries are considering taking similar measures .
the tobacco industry has been under enormous pressure against the law .
tobacco companies said that the law would promote the black market in tobacco , where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible .
&quot; the legislation will have serious unintended consequences , &quot; said Scott Mc@@ En@@ y@@ re , of British American Tobacco , in Australia .
it will increase the amount of tobacco that will be brought by China and Indonesia to sell to the streets of Australia .
other people say that their business has benefited after the law has been passed .
G@@ ra has , of Z@@ co @-@ il P@@ ty L@@ t@@ d , a small family business , said that the demand for pi@@ ti@@ d@@ gs and silicone coverage to plug the unpleasant images of the trap had soared nearly two months ago , when British American Tobacco , Willy ain &apos;s Imperial Tobacco , Philip Morris , and Japan Tobacco lost a law on the law in Australia &apos;s Supreme Court .
the lady said that Zeng had sold up to 6 000 units to wholesale shops and that she was waiting for more stocks .
&apos;@@ For us is a good business &apos; .
according to the experts , the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed .
after a series of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sports sponsorship , which force the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes into sight , the marketing of tobacco has gone into online .
Australia has banned Internet advertising for local companies and websites , but it cannot restrict it on foreign pages .
&quot; if you spend tobacco and you are only left with this small window to promote your products , the online space is the most convincing place to be , &quot; said Bec@@ ky Fre@@ eman , the public health inquiry at the University of Sydney University .
Modi remarked on an increase in headlines of &quot; ordinary citizens &quot; published on social networking websites such as YouTube , Twitter , and Facebook .
the question is whether it is just a private citizen who is really happy about the cigarettes , and he has taken the trouble to make a video or whether a marketing company is behind all of this .
Australia &apos;s British American Tobacco indicated that industry focuses more on new rules than on marketing .
the industry has even arrived to pay for Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to make use of the new rules ; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that unfair trade is being restricted , even though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia .
the WTO is likely to dictate a resolution by mid @-@ 2013 .
the government said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on packaging .
in 2001 , Canada became the first country to make it compulsory to include images in the holidays .
they are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries , including Brazil , Turkey , and Ukraine .
in Great Britain , New Zealand , South Africa , and India , stricter laws are being applied .
in Australia , many smokers are challenging .
&apos;@@ photographs do not concern me .
I simply do not do it . &apos;
&quot; you hide the cigarette and guard the package , &quot; says Victor El H@@ age while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth .
&quot; frankly , there is only one reason why he would stop smoking : by my daughter . &quot;
James Y@@ u , the manager of the Estonian King of the Pack , indicates that the uniforms are making it harder for them to put them on the shelves .
&quot; normally it would take an hour for an hour to go for delivery ; now , four , &quot; Y@@ u says Y@@ u .
&quot; the government should have completely banned tobacco , and then it is already , it is , it is enough , it is ended and we close the shop , &quot; he says while he puts his hands in the top .
in a constantly connected world , it is not so bad that it is a bit .
during this year &apos;s agenda , I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which we were flying was a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to come .
so I had a very great deal of time to think of the pat on the table .
I am not going to lie .
we spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to come is rather boring , even if you have the means to be handed over , such as books , magazines , or N@@ PP@@ s , not to forget the duty @-@ free shops .
but there are more and more academics and child @-@ development experts that praise the bon@@ ity .
according to them , it is good that , both we and our children , we are boring from time to time .
there is no doubt that the brain will be forced to find interesting options and may encourage creativity .
since , at the moment , most of us are connected to this or to that screen , we do not experience the benefits that it brings with it .
so , should we be able to give a good sense of fun ?
yes .
not .
but we will talk about it later on .
first of all , like many people , it was assumed that , now that we have more time for leisure , it would be a relatively recent phenomenon .
but , as Peter Tom@@ he@@ y , the Greek and Roman professor of history and Roman History of the University of Cal@@ er@@ a , in Canada , and author of the book &quot; Bor@@ ati@@ ence : &quot; Bor@@ er@@ ism : &quot; Ro@@ ity , an animated history , &quot; published in 2011 by Yale University , is not the case .
&quot; in fact , the tale story is very extensive , &quot; he claims .
in the Sochi walls , there are already mushrooms in Latin over the pat @-@ on that dates back to the first century D@@ J .
we also need to look at how we define the do@@ ess .
&quot; the problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways , &quot; suggests John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , a professor of meritocracy at the University of York in Onyszkiewicz , Canada .
after examining the research published and raising the idea before a discussion group consisting of 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues defined the pat @-@ on like the experience of &quot; desired , but not power , participating in an activity that is full . &quot;
it says that the difference between pi@@ ity and apathy is that the person does not do something , but he wants to do that .
it notes that with apathy , there is no desire to do something .
the main experience of nervousness , it claims , is &quot; altering the care process , associated with a low state of mind , and a sense that time is slow . &quot;
pi@@ er@@ ity may sound terribly similar to depression .
however , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood says that , although they may be related , people who are boring tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or of the world , while people who are depressed consider that the problem is .
sometimes we think we are boring , when what we actually do is that we have problems in concentrating .
in his study , &quot; The Un@@ ag@@ ag@@ ed Min@@ d Min@@ d : De@@ end@@ ing Bor@@ ati@@ zation , published in September &apos;s edition of the November edition , Professor E@@ ast@@ tic Science , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood , and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which the participants listened to a row from a person reading the article of a magazine .
some groups heard in the nearby chamber a full @-@ scale TV program that had no link , others heard it with the low , so it was barely perceptible , while the third group did not listen to the roof at any time .
the group that listened to the program with the low volume was more boring than the other two groups ; it cost them to concentrate , but they were not sure why they attributed it to the pat @-@ on .
&quot; when I try to focus on a difficult or interesting task , change in care can lead , &quot; indicated Mark J. F@@ is@@ ke , a neuro@@ scientist professor at the University of Gu@@ p@@ h , in Onyszkiewicz , and one of the authors of the study .
&quot; on the other hand , when you are doing something boring , such as detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line , a music that you would get to get you can help you to fail . &quot;
&quot; in fact , we know that to move or to act , actions that are often interpreted as boring , can actually help to combat it , because they make that person physically more alert . &quot;
&quot; research shows that children who are allowed to move more and retain more information than those to whom they are forced to stay , &quot; says Professor F@@ ag@@ ke .
we all know what is met at some point : the delay of an aeroplane , a mono@@ tone speaker , a particularly boring film .
but some people have more tendency to boast than others .
to help measure it , some researchers developed in the 1980 &quot; s a &quot; scale of pi@@ ance . &quot;
the scale includes issues such as &quot; many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and repetitive &quot; and &quot; there are so many things that I am interested that I do not have time to do everything . &quot;
the University of West Florida professor , the University of West Florida , says that , using those scales , researchers have discovered that children are more often boring than girls , and that they need more and more varied external stimulation .
but , in general , teenagers are a rather easily boring type of group .
in 1991 , Re@@ ed L@@ ed , a human and Community development professor at the University of Illinois , carried out an experiment in which to contact 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day .
he found that 32 % of teenagers said that he would be boring as he was in school or doing his homework , while 23 % said that he would be boring when he was not at school .
on the other hand , 3 % of parents said that they would be boring .
Professor Lar@@ is said that he did not know whether the current bon@@ ity percentages , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
but he said that what he did know was that &quot; adolescence is a period in which he is hitting its peak , &quot; largely because both children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control over what they want to do .
so , to return to my question of the principle : is it good enough ?
sometimes it is not , because , led to the extreme , it may be that we are exposing ourselves to absurd physical risks , such as making bets or falling into the use of substances as a means of combating it , as demonstrated by the investigations .
many philosophers and writers , on the other hand , talk about the connection between pi@@ er@@ ity and creativity , as Professor Van ard@@ ich , who has been looking at this issue , says for more than two decades .
&quot; it is the way in which you have the brain to tell you to be doing something else , &quot; says Gary Mar@@ us , the University of New York University professor .
but the brain does not always know what is best .
if you are boring and using that energy to touch the beautiful or cook , you will be happy to do so .
but if you watch television , you may be satisfied in the short term , but not in the long term .
&quot; so , if your son is boring and has an anti@@ ad , you may no longer be boring , but you will not have learned to be taken for yourself or to be treated , &quot; says Professor F@@ ag@@ ke .
and &quot; this test capacity is applied to other situations , &quot; he points out .
your son not only learns to take himself on his own , but he learns to be better controlled in other areas .
I do not think that we really want to praise the ni@@ est .
but we should not be too critical of it either .
our aim should , rather , be to be comfortable with the constant rumour of activities and technologies .
Professor E@@ ast@@ wood agrees .
&quot; in our view , we need to be filled with more , but shrimp is too distressing and worrying as to link it with something worthy of it , &quot; he claims .
it points out that what people are really looking for is a way of shutting down and enjoying a dead time .
&quot; in an environment in which we are constantly over @-@ stimulated , &quot; he says , &quot; It is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops . &quot;
cold : no book book for the New Law on marijuana consumption
to have a 19 @-@ year @-@ old student , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old student in an EU @-@ south South @-@ East Center , is faced with a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state : the possession of marijuana stones and a p@@ pa that he used to smoke .
he says that a September , he and some friends led by Lam@@ ar , on the plains close to the Kansas border , when the police stopped .
the police found marijuana in the car , and a later time afterwards received a court case for the possession of drugs and relative articles ( minor offences that entail a one $ 100 US fine ) in which they were informed of the date of trial .
&quot; we treat criminals like criminals , &quot; he says , he says .
and are they ?
in the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalisation of the possession of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use , the response in hundreds of minor cases for holding drugs depends less on the law than on the location .
hundreds of minor crimes for marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington , where a similar measure was adopted .
police departments have ceased to present charges against the more than 21 years for small @-@ scale possession , which will be legally adopted once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks .
but the prosecutors of more conservative districts in Colorado have committed themselves to continuing cases with marijuana possession , and they are still quoting people .
at the same time , several cities , from the suburbs of Denver to the West mountains , are voting to prevent the newly authorised marijuana shops in their communities from being opened up recently .
&quot; all of this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the next , &quot; said Daniel J. O@@ , , head of police in A@@ am@@ ora , right to the Denver .
those who deal with the government regulations in Washington are also going back on the matter .
and they are still looking for advice to establish a system of production , manufacturing , distribution and sale licences - all of them before the deadline , on 1 December 2013 .
they say that , for better or for worse , Colorado is ahead of most states with regard to regulating the use of marijuana , first for computerized purposes , and now for recreational use .
&quot; the world has a more regulated market , so it will be a good guide , &quot; it says , Brian E Smith , the spokesman of the Committee on controlling the state of Washington .
but Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions as to what might work .
&quot; there is no real precedent that will serve as a model , &quot; he claims .
the Washington Act , called I @-@ 5@@ 02 , comes into force on 6 December , which leaves a year during which it will be swimming between two waters , as the licensing system in that state will not exist yet , but possession will be legal .
moreover , there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period , such as the way to maintain a balance between the state &apos;s demand to provide a &quot; adequate access &quot; to authorised marijuana and its ban on cannabis business on a radius of less than 300 metres in schools , parks , children &apos;s play areas , or child centres .
&quot; nowhere will it become more difficult to locate a authorised cannabis business than in urban areas , especially in the Seattle metropolitan area , &quot; says Ben Dzurinda , the Centre spokesman for legal cannabis , a recently established research group .
on 21 November , O@@ F , the A@@ e@@ ur police head of police , sent an e @-@ mail to their police officers reporting that the city &apos;s prosecutor would cease to act in a court of parental charge for people over the age of 21 , and that the police would cease to present charges against these crimes &quot; with immediate effect . &quot;
the O@@ F police head said that they would be responsible for enforcing the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug traffickers and dealers .
in the county of Wexford , in the north of Colorado , the district &apos;s prosecutor , Ken b@@ ick , represents a tougher vision .
after the vote , he assured that his office would still persecute marijuana possession cases , mainly to put pressure on consumers and that they decide to receive treatment .
today , 119 people face charges of 56 g or less marijuana , even though many of them have other charges .
&quot; our office has a duty to bring prosecutions against those errors that , at the time when it was criminal , &quot; said Mr Titford in a statement .
the response has been complicated even in places like the countryside in the Bureau , where voters rejected the initiative on the legalisation of marijuana .
the Grand Juncker police , the largest city in the county , no longer cite adults for possession of small quantities .
the prosecutor of the county of County , he supported this decision , but he also decided not to dismiss any of the cases outstanding by office .
&quot; I do not think that he is losing time by continuing to enforce the law until he change , &quot; he said .
although 55 % of voters supported the measure , it was never considered that taking marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judiciary would be easy .
the conflicting reactions emerging by the whole state show a marked ambivalence among officials of the great environmental experiment in this state .
&quot; it is a cultural barrier to district prosecutors , &quot; Se@@ an Mc@@ Allister , a MDC lawyer who represents defendants , who is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of the In@@ secure Act .
&quot; they have spent so long on people before the courts that , in reality , they are not yet able to accept that it is legal , &quot; he said .
by being the first states to regard small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if it were alcohol , Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the test cases at national level in terms of the legalisation of drugs .
while lawyers and state officials are counting on a new border of legal sales , they also eagerly await indications from the federal government , which still provides for the consideration of marijuana sale and cultivation as federal crimes .
defenders of marijuana legalisation have the hope that the Department of Justice will give .
although there have been some prominent arrests of marijuana patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes , the federal government has , for the most part , been able to allow marijuana sales business for the purposes in Colorado , Washington , and 16 more states .
&quot; although drug agents are likely not to throw away a small drug exchange down to confiscate a small drug stock , they will probably be reluctant to allow the state @-@ regulated shops to operate for leisure use , permitted in the new law , &quot; put in , K@@ 366a A. Saberi , an anti @-@ drug policy adviser to the Obama administration .
several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act .
even before the election day , some local governments adopted defaults on any new car shop , even though it will be around a year before any of them can be opened .
last week , a six @-@ month ban was adopted in the western city of Mon@@ ro@@ es , and it is likely that it will be adopted next week .
&quot; we do not want to be in a position where we allow someone to be allowed , and then we have a serious problem at federal level , &quot; explained Bob Nicholson , a member of the municipality .
&quot; our community voted against this amendment .
we are studying in favour of what the community voted against in order to vote in favour of what the state voted for .
many questions have been asked about this .
F@@ on@@ ella W@@ y@@ at@@ t : &quot; I was harassed until Oxford for being a Tor@@ y &apos; .
the university &apos;s views are not attacked only now .
I do not remember at any point in my life that you have not been dreaming in getting a square at Oxford University .
both my father and my biggest brother had been in which I was supposed to be the best place in the world to learn , a Greek symposium in the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilisation : free thinking and tolerance .
at the end of the 1980s , however , in the last couple of weeks to occupy my square in the Work in the Day of the end of the 1980s , I had already given your bags , which triggered the first scandal of my life .
my father collapsed , and he was shot .
my friends were perplexed .
the E@@ ven@@ ing Standard said that I had abandoned because he did not tolerate a number of university colleagues having sexual relations in the room .
author A. N@@ . Wilson announced a joke that he had gone because I was forced to drink at a c@@ ade .
the truth was less amusing .
I came out there .
yes , I died , because he had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation .
not because of my bizarre name , or the fact that it came from a private school .
I had been harassed for a single reason , that at the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric : my father , the late Wessberg , was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party .
perhaps you would ask what is happening now .
well , several reports indicate that a new generation of center @-@ right students is suffering from similar persecution .
the institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that , last week , a group called for the same level of equal rights as homosexuals , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
Conservatives in the J@@ SE ( a level student grouping ) of the Cor@@ ner School , the College states that they are &quot; often seriously paragraphs , personally attacked and treated as non @-@ alkali people &quot; for their political ideas .
they want to create a seat on the equal opportunities committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their opinions freely .
its situation was not helped by a recent documentary from the B@@ ER@@ B@@ 2 called &quot; W@@ on@@ land : Y@@ oun@@ le , Car@@ right and on the Net : young , brilliant , and right @-@ wing students &quot; policy on students &quot; policy , which he presented to the Tories as ec@@ centric and neo @-@ Nazis .
he taught the pre @-@ hearing Joe Co@@ o@@ ke , Head of the Association of the Conservative Party at Oxford University ( O@@ SE ) , in a Pri@@ ls @-@ Bol@@ ce , wearing a silver lining and a stick with a silver lining .
in other universities , conservative students say that they are treated as &quot; Turkish heads &quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ deputy Vice @-@ President of the Conservative Party &apos;s Conservative Party at the University of Pennsylvania declared in a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there is a growing left @-@ wing trend in universities .
people assume that we are like Good Club without even knowing us . &quot;
a 21 @-@ year @-@ old 21 @-@ year @-@ school student of the story on the motion for a better protection , he says that this environment is &quot; inconvenient , &quot; whereas St@@ an@@ an@@ ic Ch@@ ag@@ ll , 19 @-@ year @-@ elected president of the O@@ CA@@ A , says that the attitude of the nominees to people who are center @-@ right has worsened .
&quot; this poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate , as well as to the well @-@ being of members , &quot; he claims .
during my first weeks in Oxford I was more than one .
I attended the university in September 1986 , a young 18 @-@ year @-@ old young age .
hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point .
the previous year , the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher , ancient student na , a &apos; honour of the cause &apos; after the cuts in the funding of higher education .
the atmosphere would have shocked the horror of any Stalinist .
during the first few days of the week of welcoming the new universities , when the new students are known and know the professors , I received a show of the bitterness I was expecting .
I found that the professors did not only turn a blind eye to the joke that was made of conservative academics , but that they were very much involved .
the policy of the mining strike , privatisation and opposition from the government to the anti @-@ apartheid sanctions in South Africa went into the workshop &apos;s timber rooms .
at the first time I attended the English the eighteenth century French texts and I was not ready for what came next .
&quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; professor &apos;s professor , the professor of the professor , Tax , &quot; please translate the first paragraph . &quot;
I did not have one .
P@@ t , a low @-@ minded man with a face that seemed mass of bizarre , knew well how to expel bad bi@@ is .
&quot; is it the French people who refuse to learn French , or are they simply to be stupid ? . &quot; he asked .
the other graduates were left .
I took the eyes of the tears that I was trying to contain .
&quot; I suggest you go to French classes in your free time , as long as you are not too busy knowing people , &quot; set out taxi .
I went back to my room as a pity .
that evening I sat alone at the dinner at the university ; then I felt a slight pat on the back .
he was a second @-@ year English student called James , who was presented as a member of the O@@ CA@@ A .
&quot; I know who you are , &quot; he kindly told me .
I fear that is the way it is .
you are going with anyone who is suspected of being Tor@@ y .
it is very difficult for me , but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so you will be even worse for you .
many T@@ ar@@ es newcomers are newcomers to be Labour . &quot;
later on , in a local p@@ b , I tried to be cowardly .
I would stress that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher said .
that trick was useless .
a first year @-@ old student of Fi@@ lo@@ y , the Political and Financial Policy , which , paradoxically , had studied in E@@ ton , said : &apos; you are the daughter of a fascist pig .
you are contaminated . &apos;
other students took this ministry .
I became a dirty dirty .
&quot; how do you have sexual relations ? &quot; he asked one .
&quot; you are beating one another , is it not ? &quot;
I felt in the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960 &quot; s .
could one day lead a normal life in Oxford ?
would you have to be left with people to think like me only after I have to think ?
would I have to become a Labour and suppress my natural trends ?
the three years that I was expected to have been presented as a pur@@ y of ostracism and isolation .
the only frank professor in the Middle East was Mar@@ ja S@@ tone , Professor de facto history for my university college .
he hated him for being not only a Conservative party , but also a Thatcher adviser in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches .
it was hardly there .
he was the place for him to be regarded as provincial and insignificant , and for his adherence to the Marxist vision of the mini @-@ party of history .
in 1997 , he accepted a holding at the University of Bi@@ k@@ ent in Ankara , in Ankara .
&quot; he is not going to be happy , &quot; he told me .
I began to travel from Oxford at the home of my parents in London on a daily basis , finding refuge in my relatives and more open metropolitan friends .
I told my father who hated Oxford and why .
I did not think .
when he studied there in the 40 years , all political points of view were accepted .
&quot; but if it is the best place in the world , &quot; he said with sadness .
&quot; they would never do that , not there .
my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude . &quot;
their painful eyes began to reproduce .
&quot; give another opportunity .
I am sure you have done that just to joke .
I would be behind the heart if it were abandoned .
in the eyes of so many trips to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
a friend of mine , who also supported the Conservative Party , had succumbed to the pressure , and had renounced his creed .
the next week , during a seminar in which another professor of history had implied , quite seriously , that I was an &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
it is a shame that I admitted that my parents had &apos; laundering the brain &apos; and called them &apos; old stupid &apos; .
the truce was short @-@ term .
it was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford .
at that time , my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press .
my door was closed with key .
I was in a fear of fear and , five minutes , my supporters abandoned .
when I got the bathwater , I got the first train to London .
I never returned .
perhaps you would call me a weak cry .
but no 18 @-@ year @-@ old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution .
what is even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party , but is , today , hiding behind a reputation that is not worthy of equality and freedom of thought .

the world &apos;s hardest @-@ cut : the humans of K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ ah &apos;s human beings .
for four euros , the Canary Islands of the Indonesian volcano are playing life and health by weighing 70 kilograms of sulphur through set @-@ aside paths of stone
there are people for whom their work is a hell and another which , literally , works in hell .
this is the case of An@@ ar Wijsenbeek , one of the 400 miners who earn their living on the sulphur by the volcano K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ in , the east of the Indonesian island of Jos .
in order to do so , it has to go down every day to the fund of its crude se@@ ter , where sul@@ fur@@ bears gas that comes from the world &apos;s earth is consolidated by entering into contact with the air .
after launching large sulphur rocks , almost 70 kilos , they are caught up in two a b@@ ade , which is the burden on their shoulders through sharp gear .
it is only 250 metres up to the top of the volcano , which is up to 2.@@ 3@@ 86 meters , but the exhausted airlines take more than 40 minutes to move at a snail &apos;s pace , balancing the balance and measuring their steps so that they do not slip down and fall over the cliff .
they know that any drift could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourists who took off years ago by the Mal@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ es &quot; sh@@ ies .
the miners of K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ in earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur that they extract .
once up , there are opening @-@ up among tourists that photograph@@ ers were as a circus , and , by burdening the heavy bloggers , they walk three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has placed a little lower , at 1 850 metres .
it is a matter of PT C@@ di N@@ am@@ im@@ bi , a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 , and , never again , its workers , whom it pays for 6@@ 62 of Indonesia ( 5 cents of the euro ) for every kilo of sulphur .
then it sells it for 10 000 mut@@ ants ( 83 cents of the euro ) into the petrochemical industry , as this ore is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture c@@ ren@@ c@@ ges , fireworks , cosmetics , dynam@@ ite , and even for the laundering of sugar .
&quot; as usual is to bear 70 kg , we extract some 4@@ 6,000 ( EUR 3.8 ) on every trip , &quot; explains An@@ to , who usually takes three daily papers .
it takes three hours in each one and it ends up , but it allows them to pool 13@@ 8,000 ( EUR 1@@ 1.5 ) at the end of the day .
although it seems to be a pittance in such inhumane effort , it is three times the size of what would be gained in the field .
&quot; the miners &apos; Day is very high here , where the coffee collection is paid to 15 000 s@@ as ( 1.2 ) day , and the half @-@ monthly salary is two million ru@@ pi@@ as ( EUR 167 ) , &quot; clarifies the portfolio , which was previously worked as a kidney for the tourism island of Bali .
there , his salary was at 75 000 euros ( EUR 6.@@ 2 ) on the day , and packaging was not so hard , but An@@ ar has returned with his family to the village to the volcano , a people close to the volcano , for a major reason , in Indonesia , that he married me to a young man in Bali , where they are Hindus , and I have brought the Hindu , and I have brought it to the region to turn to Islam . &quot;
to have asthma , they breathe with difficulty , they breathe , they are constantly getting their eyes on toxic gases .
for its 27 years , An@@ ar three years are playing the skin in the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en , whose sulphur has already begun to pass bill , despite covering the face with a special mask and glasses .
it has asthma , they breathe with difficulty , they are constantly getting to grips with the toxic gases that lay down the volcano .
it is the price that you should pay to achieve your dream .
I will be more than two years old because I want to open a shop , or study Spanish or French , &apos; promises in a more than acceptable English .
for his life for life , this clever and intelligent young person could be a tourist , shrimp , or recipient of a hotel , but instead he is doing the work of a move .
with wood as a whole herd of timber with other carriers , there is an end to the two of the night , because sulphur does not leave it on the back of night when its distinctive colour is blue and in the midst of darkness .
in the face of the shadows , An@@ low to tar , with a small domestic small leave , joined by their hull , which he himself bought with his money .
a 400 of these sulphur sinks on their shoulders from the bottom of the nitrofen fund .
despite its great profits , the mining company has not capitalized on the extraction of sulphur in order to save costs and does not provide any equipment for the directory , working on their own , and so much the weight .
in fact , they do not even see some of the 30 000 euros ( EUR 2.5 ) per chamber , which , together with the entry of 15 000 mut@@ ants ( EUR 1.2 ) , to the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to paint the volcano and its human mu@@ ches .
&quot; this work is for pests and not for people , &quot; &quot; protest Mad@@ bl@@ a , a 42 @-@ year @-@ old driving force in the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ ah in three decades , ever since he left school .
able to lift up to 110 kg , he will ensure that he will be able to work &quot; as much as he can &quot; because he needs the money to educate his three children , between 18 and 10 years .
I will not retire , I will die here because the volcano has been my life .
even if sulphur burning the throat and sp@@ its eyes when the wind is changing fast and caught the miners in the columns that come out of the volcano , they are so tough that nobody complains about serious diseases - beyond , of course , their usual breathing problems , ho@@ sis , pain on their knees , and the shoulders of the shoulders of their shoulders , which have been abused by the peso .
by tying the basket on its back , Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k can no longer charge 50 kilograms to its 53 years .
every day , he and his colleagues are pulling out 15 tonnes of sulphur to the volcano , which three lorries move on to the store of Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 kilometres away from goats to the bathwater .
&quot; I will not retire , I will die here because the volcano has been my life , &quot; proclaims Un@@ a@@ ini@@ i@@ k is opening up his mouth , where he has a number of teeth .

Paris to save the Economy
fast @-@ moving paths blame the race , stress , and cost of property and education for not having children .
&quot; the population of Singapore needs to grow . &quot;
I am a patriotic husband , are my patriotic wife , live with our civic duty and create life !
it may seem unlikely that these tracks will be part of an announcement of a m@@ age advertisement , but , despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year .
the phrases are part of a ritual using local references like &quot; We are going to put a pawn ( g@@ le ) on the m@@ do &quot; to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore .
the advertising company that the video did , B@@ B@@ H , is in the hope that the announcement will make it possible to draw attention to the problem in a different way .
his creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says that he wanted to use the music &apos;s power in order for people to comply with &quot; their national duty . &quot;
this is something purely about the Internet , so we had to make it fun and fun .
it is the biggest problem in that country .
we are the worst in the world in re@@ producing ourselves , so we feel that this was an issue we had to deal with .
we knew that the government had tried a great deal , as to launch per@@ om@@ ons , or to organise fast @-@ tracking ( s@@ ag@@ ed @-@ d@@ tics ) .
many of these ideas may have been creative , but not necessarily worked .
so we think , why are we not doing as creative as possible to solve this problem , which is to deploy a ritual ?
children &apos;s Children
it is the Singapore government that is not taken so lightly .
it spends $ 300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children .
a government package for marriages and parents grants up to $ 15 000 per child , extends maternity leave and distribute tax benefits .
but all of this has had little effect .
Singapore is a rich and high @-@ tech city in south @-@ east Asia , also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls .
Singapore &apos;s birth rate , according to its national population division , is currently placed at 1.2 children per woman .
the last time that he was above 2 - known as a re @-@ position - was in 1976 .
so why do you not have more children ?
both Wei M@@ ing , the National Population Division , says that it is because of a &quot; better education &quot; and &quot; a wider range of career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; this has enabled people to have a broader range of options in terms of life @-@ and @-@ priorities , beyond married and forming a family , &quot; explains .
these changes to social standards have contributed to the increase in the window , and to delay marriage and birth , resulting in a drop in the birth rate in Singapore .
in the meantime , an immigration policy will lead to a sharp increase in immigration in order to deal with the decline in the population , which has created resentment among the local population .
in Singapore , there are websites in which there is a lot of xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants , particularly the Chinese , to those who are critical of maintaining low wages and not joining .
the increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore &apos;s government party experienced its worst electoral outcome last year since independence .
since the elections , there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with higher quotas and charges for foreign workers .
unexpected consequences
while the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation &apos;s economic growth , tax revenues , health costs , and immigration policies , the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences .
the government is trying not to build so many small houses .
for example , it has begun to affect the housing sector .
the urban development authority has shifted to control the number of small flats , known as the &apos; box of shoes &apos; , which can be built in certain areas of the city .
these flats have limits to 46 square metres and have had a great deal of sales success .
however , there are concerns that they can promote a luxury lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large , family houses .
but L@@ im Y@@ Assessment So@@ on , the Director @-@ General of the J@@ au@@ ens housing company , says that his &quot; watch boxes &quot; are sold much faster than the larger units .
they are more popular , in the sense that units are depleted days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
this makes it much better for our cash flow .
however , it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers , who were previously placed in the way of obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project .
very stressful
Singapore is a state @-@ owned city .
while these new rules can be a step towards the rise of the national birth rate , talking to the hard @-@ pressed levers working in the center &apos;s financial district seemed not to have a great deal of effect .
&quot; people are very stressed , houses are expensive , and so are education , so many people are postponing it , &quot; says a young executive .
other people can have children .
&quot; but for me it is important to have my own money and time , &quot; he says a young man of about 20 years .
men and women mention their career , stress , and the cost of property and education as the reasons for having children .
so , however much the government is trying to push its citizens to have children , when it comes to doing babies , it is those who have the last word .
the private off @-@ line private on @-@ line
privacy .
according to the Royal Academy of the Royal Royal Academy , it is a question of private life or &quot; the field of private life that has the right to protect any interference . &quot;
what is private for a lesser of 16 years ?
how does this definition apply in their daily lives and in social networks ?
does the danger of the dangers to which it is exposed to fly on the Internet situations that I would certainly not share out of line ?
it gave five people aged between 10 and 15 years , frequent Internet users .
in four cases , they linked the term to &quot; something very mine , &quot; at a personal level , and &quot; in the key and name of the user , &quot; when they applied it to social networks .
&quot; my deeper secrets would not bring them into a post , &quot; says George , ten years old , when he tries to explain the meaning of private in sites such as Facebook , Twitter , H@@ ot@@ mail , and Win@@ d@@ ry Li@@ d@@ ger M@@ le@@ ger , where he has been accountable for two years .
&quot; they are very secret secrets , my mother can know them , but not everyone , &quot; he claims .
in F@@ B sub @-@ images or games .
I have also been given the opportunity to speak to you .
&quot; I would not share a photo other than mine , or someone who is making ridicule , &quot; says .
the child recognises that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs , naked people , crimes , or write humiliating or violent comments .
China ensures that the 35 friends that it has in F@@ B and its nine in Twitter will be known to it .
the majority are relatives .
the mother is included , he has the key to one of the accounts .
I made Twitter to speak out and write interesting corrections .
&quot; I don &apos;t know whether he replied , me alone , he adds .
&quot; social networks are handed over , I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends quickly , &quot; he suggests .
no doubt in answering that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
he would not be able to take the case to someone who recommended him to a stranger .
the case of José , 14 years old , is different .
the teenager has open @-@ handed accounts in H@@ ot@@ mail , Facebook , M@@ , , and As@@ k , in the latter , he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends .
&quot; I am not afraid , because we have something in common , music for example , &quot; he suggests .
according to the child , neither has been implied or asked for his house or telephone number .
&quot; if I put pressure on me , or asked me to push me on my own account , &quot; he recognizes .
José took a fan of As@@ k , after reading a recommendation in Twitter .
the boys are not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyber @-@ hopping .
a well @-@ known one of my friend was blackmailing him on a social net .
they were threatened and asked for money .
&quot; he never knew who was , &quot; he ensures .
the victim , according to José , did not close the bill .
&quot; he only put him in privacy . &quot;
he then explains a number of steps to make the case in a safe way .
unlike George , this boy would raise photos of known people in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
I would do that if you were wrong or willing .
&quot; although I know that is cybercrime , &quot; he says .
key questions
the masterpiece , a masterpiece of English and a graduate in education and training , considers that , in order to guide children and adolescents , it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to report .
&quot; the Internet emerged as a means of finding information , but with the drift of these sites changed the rules of the game , &quot; he mentions .
he points out that the academic Marc P@@ ang@@ sky , a master of Yale &apos;s University of Yale and the native and non @-@ migrant work such as this , coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
digital natives are they , children and young people who were born with technology .
&quot; we are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them , when we are still learning , &quot; says .
he says that the subject is a complex one , &quot; because we are asking you to have a clear criterion on what is right or not to spread , publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that . &quot;
&quot; also to be selective when what matters most to you is to be popular , to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences , &quot; adds .
according to the specialist , the most effective way of teaching what is the privacy of children and adolescents is by asking them to reflect .
&apos;@@ You do not do it &apos; , you add .
then there are some options that are lists : there are things that do not tie in to a stranger , why do you do it on the Internet ?
or would you like to publish a photo of you such as the one that is published by a friend ?
do you know what the others are publishing on you ?
when you label holiday pictures , do you allow the other people to be allowed to label them ?
and one more , do you need to know what you are doing every time ?
another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do on line .
they are the same rules .
&quot; one out of the Internet acts with respect , morality , and other principles , just as it should be on social networks , &quot; he claims .
monitoring
in the words of a college , a university professor , a primary teacher and education consultant , he said that it is essential for family parents to read the policies of social networks .
in understanding each other , they have solid foundations for dealing with their children about the implications of opening an Internet account .
&quot; for example , age , and what is allowed to share or publish , &quot; he says .
according to the Guard , it is key to remind children of the lesson of &quot; not with strangers . &quot;
closure Summit without making public the Lima Declaration
the sixth presidential summit in the African Union of Nations ( Un@@ as@@ ur ) ended up today in Peru without the Lima Declaration , which was announced beforehand and theoretically signed by the seven assistants , being made public .
by the way , it tried to have repeated opportunities access to the document signed in the 18th Meeting of heads of state and government of Heads of State and Government , but sources of Chancellor of the Presidency indicated at a beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closure , but then claimed that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian Government &apos;s web .
being consulted on the text , they pointed out that the content had been set out by Peru &apos;s president , O@@ ed@@ ta Humala , for a few brief statements to the press .
access for journalists to information at the summit was restricted at all times .
during the day only , in the press room , un@@ sound video of the presidential assembly was conveyed to the presidential assembly with the message that &quot; private session , it was restricted . &quot;
the little information that was circulating among the reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of Un@@ as@@ as@@ ur assistants to the quotation , although not Peru .
the only document released during the day was the list of Presidents , which caused the unrest of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for greater data .
then Peru &apos;s Presidency sent an e @-@ mail to the media with the summit &apos;s &quot; final declaration &quot; , but it is Humala &apos;s statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
last October , Peru hosted the North South @-@ Arab People Summit ( A@@ PA ) , and on that occasion , even though it was strongly demanded by the press , the so @-@ called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced did not spread .
in the official A@@ PA website , it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday .
in both international meetings , the Peruvian authorities struggled to secure insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited the collection of information as much as possible .
the summit also concluded with the joint undertaking by Chile and Peru to accept a Hague ruling in The Hague , which is a cross @-@ border dispute between the two countries .
Peru &apos;s presidents , O@@ no@@ ta Humala , and Chile , Michelle Piñera , met during the regional quotation and ratified that it will respect the ( CI@@ J ) decision , which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both sides , in the process that Lima put forward against Santiago .
&quot; we will follow and implement the sentence that defines the differences that we are now taking to this international court , &quot; that Humala said , along with his Chilean couple .
&quot; Chile has been , is and will remain a country respectful of international law , of the peaceful settlement of disputes , treaties , and international courts , &quot; added it , and welcomed with a hand @-@ in @-@ hand to Humala , together with the flags of the two countries .
the confirmation by both presidents that they will be submitted to the CI@@ J then took place in Colombia this week to denounce the Bogota Pact that it had agreed to be subject to the rulings of that international court , after a decision on sea limits with Nicaragua , which was considered to be seriously flawed .
the summit was carried out with the attendance of Brazil &apos;s presidents , Dilma Rouhani , Venezuela , Hugo Chávez ; Bolivia , Evo Morales ; and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
Paraguay , suspended from 2011 , after its former President Fernando Lu@@ go &apos;s dismissal , did not participate in the quotation .
the host president , O@@ no@@ ta Humala , was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit , shortly after the Lima meeting .
the head read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and action lines were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $ 17 billion in investment .
among the agreements adopted mentioned that the UNRWA will be giving &apos; important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are extending the residence agreements &apos; .
he reported that action is being taken to improve &quot; cooperation in the fight against public insecurity and cross @-@ border organised crime , actions to make medicines more accessible , access to the Internet in all corners of South America , and to care jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters . &quot;
with a Europe in crisis , &quot; economic consolidation ( from Latin America ) should not have a triumphant parent , but must serve to widen productive matrix and look at a better future for our peoples , &quot; added Humala .
&quot; we have decided to privilege a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South America &apos;s spaces , especially in rural and border areas - uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits , &quot; Mr Peruvian said in a message reading .
among these projects , he mentioned that five correspond to Peru , and they are located on the cross @-@ border axes of their territory , from the coast to Brazil , and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador , though it did not give more detail .
the final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay .
&quot; we hope that the election process in that country will serve to return to the Union of South American Nations , &quot; which is currently excluded .
the need for Latin America to be maintained as a region of prosperity and peace , an integrated region , and good relations between neighbours , was another of the issues highlighted by the summit .
in this sense , Colombia &apos;s president Juan Manuel Santos said before he began his participation in the regional quotation that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , in Mexico on Saturday to deal in respectful sea @-@ breaking following an CI@@ J ruling , questioned by Bogota .
&quot; the day of tomorrow ( Saturday ) it may be that he has a meeting with President Daniel Ortega , &quot; Santos said .
&quot; we are going to revise all these paths , they are not exclusive , including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua , &quot; he underlined .
&quot; with President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we manage this in the most civilised and respectful manner , &quot; he added Santos .
Santos and Ortega would be found on Saturday in Mexico where they intend to attend the leadership of the country &apos;s new president , Enrique Peña Nieto .
similarly , as part of the summit , the bloc Defense ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , Bra@@ in@@ am , and Paraguay , UN@@ AS@@ CO@@ CO@@ CO@@ CO@@ R@@ CO@@ CO@@ R@@ CO@@ CO@@ the latter , although the latest country is suspended .
Peru has the presidency for the regional bloc .
&quot; South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship &quot; : Raphael for the sake of citizenship .
Ecuador &apos;s President , the President of Ecuador , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which &quot; South America , in this case , should learn from Europe . &quot;
de facto , who took part in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations ( Un@@ as@@ ur ) , held in Lima , declared state TV Peru that Europeans &quot; were killed in World War II and in other conflicts , &quot; but now almost a homeland . &quot;
he defended , in this respect , the project to establish the intra @-@ American citizenship that the member countries of Un@@ as@@ ur encourage .
&quot; the free mobility of citizens and workers must be achieved by any South American country , as is already the case with members of the Andean Community , but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return to the past , &quot; warned .
the author &apos;s author was also in favour of the re @-@ establishment of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , under the premise of lowering the influence of Anglo @-@ Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on human rights .
they are never committed to anything but , on the other hand , we , the Americans , sign everything .
&quot; it is incomprehensible that the Inter @-@ American Human Rights Commission is in Washington under US funding , &quot; stated in reference to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .
he assured him that he did not regret that decision because he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his &quot; deep democratic and human rights values . &quot;
he added that , at the time , &quot; there were justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country , and that his process would not be respected . &quot;
he also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that it should be subject to interrogation by a alleged sexual offence when &quot; the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done through video video , that it could be done from the Ecuador embassy in London . &quot;
he said that there is a risk that Assange &apos;s physical and mental health is deteriorating .
&quot; I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem , nothing serious , &quot; he said , he said .
what does exist is the danger that physical and mental health will be undermined because it is locked in a small space without being able to exercise open @-@ air exercises .
&quot; that complicates any person &apos;s health , &quot; he added .
they said that the solution to asylum given to Assange since June in London &apos;s molecular embassy , by granting a saving to Ecuador , is in the hands of Britain , Sweden , and European legal authorities , and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the arrest of WikiLeaks .
we do not negotiate on human rights , that word we do not use in this case , but there have been permanent talks .
&quot; the solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain , Sweden , and European legal authorities because Assange &apos;s lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ ar Gar@@ z@@ on , is making a number of procedures in different European bodies , &quot; he mentioned .
and he said that , &quot; If Britain tomorrow provides for this , it will stop . &quot;
and if Sweden , as its legislation allows , and as it has done in other cases , questioned Mr Assange in the Ecuador embassy in London , or is a question a matter of question , Mr Assange will come to the end of this problem tomorrow .
they used to assert themselves as an advocate of press freedom , and fine words that what it does not tolerate is &quot; mediocrity , bad faith , and lie , which undermine freedom of expression . &quot;
&quot; the greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil , evil politicians , but bad journalists on the basis of profit , blackmail , and extortion , &quot; he said .
in that respect , it was welcomed that they are no longer these journalists , &quot; neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois creditor countries dominate Ecuador , &quot; and advanced that they would be re @-@ elected to &quot; deepen the revolution in order to continue the path and the right direction . &quot;
they also supported the decision to keep Paraguay in Paraguay at least until its next election , arguing that the body &quot; must be firm and not tolerated opportunism and the coup d &apos;être of legality &quot; because it has in reality &quot; destroyed the legitimacy of a golden democracy . &quot;
the author of the author also considered &quot; perfectly relevant &quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel Santos , to negotiate now with Nicaragua the sea limits between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , which benefited Northern Nicaragua &apos;s maritime sovereignty .
at the moment , this failure is not in place .
it is a problem between a South American and a Central American country .
conflicts are inevitable , but they must be overcome by the will to walk together .
they need to be processed in a broad way to overcome them and move forward .
I also relied on a good conclusion of the sea @-@ limit dispute that they keep in the court of court Peru and Chile , and said that it is right for Latin America to seek international bodies if the two countries commit themselves to accept the ultimate fault . &quot;
referring to the eventuality to be presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term of office , he said that he sees that possibility &quot; with a great deal of optimism and joy , though sometimes quite hard . &quot;
Mahathir assured him that if he loses the February election of 2013 , he will withdraw from public life .
I have never been interested in power in a personal capacity , but in situations as unjust as in Ecuador that socio @-@ economic poverty can only be corrected from political power .
&apos;@@ I thought I was the man who guaranteed that likely victory , because we have to accept that re @-@ use , &quot; he said .
to win would be my last period in the presidency , and that is what we are leaving for public life .
if we lose the same .
&quot; it is a decision , &quot; he said .
they also referred to the new health @-@ care treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba .
I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice @-@ President Nicholas Maduro and he tells me that he travelled to a treatment that was already planned , routine , that the campaign to return to Cuba was expected .
&quot; does not mean a relapse into President Chávez &apos;s state of health , &quot; he commented .
the molecular head of state participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( Un@@ as@@ ur ) , which ended up with calls for greater regional integration in order to sustain progress , equality and security .
deaths of AIDS today are the cause of late detection .
F@@ opening was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the result of the test : positive AIDS .
&quot; it was as if I had a bomb , &quot; in the wake of the announcement , that the doctor was trying to do &quot; more than &quot; , with no obvious success .
the child concealed him from his family .
he decided to take on his disease only and began to be informed about it , with such an undertaking that he has already celebrated his birthday .
it is , of course , one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit for the Civil Hospital in Gu@@ champions ( H@@ C@@ G ) , which it arrived in 1994 after several battles .
the virus of the human immune ( HIV ) virus has lived for 22 years , which is difficult to imagine in the early 1990 &quot; s , when there were many doubts , few treatment options , and more stigma .
so , even the editor of a radar in the IM@@ SS prevented him from getting rid of him , &quot; because he came from a cut @-@ off . &quot;
then , having AIDS was synonymous with death .
it is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it in quality of life .
but , ignorant of their illness , many people still arrive when the virus has already caused havoc , &quot; exhausted &quot; its immune system and victims of opportunistic infections .
to 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world , at least of the first cases reported , &quot; the great achievement means that the over @-@ life of a patient who begins treatment in the right way and the over@@ lives of the general population is exactly the same , &quot; he indicated the head of the H@@ C@@ G HIV Unit , the Wahhabi , after mentioning that this information was endorsed in April of this year in prestigious scientific publication .
the scientists had concluded that , since 2008 , the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence since 2008 .
in simple words , this means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive to 25 years , under these terms &quot; as long as they are kept in check , will be able to live without problems until 75 years &apos; , explained the interviewed .
to mark this progress , we should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average .
while mortality has declined significantly in recent years , in the case of Mexico , the number of people who die of AIDS fell from 6.@@ 6@@ 78 cases in 2007 to 4.@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 ( North AIDS &apos;s annual report ) , it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS , 60 % of patients at the national data base have died .
it is only in the event that 255 000 people died in 2011 , and 187 deaths were made in May this year ; however , there is a guarantee that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005 .
- Why is there still deaths ?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment .
this is what has happened in our hospital .
at least in the last 12 years we have not had the problem of medicine out of touch with the problem . the problem is that patients are very advanced because they are unaware of their condition of infection , that is to say , in late stages of the disease .
he gave a strong statement : &quot; nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality are to make more early diagnosis , and thus evidence for mass detection , all those who require it . &quot;
in his proposal , specialists and civil servants of the State Council for HIV Prevention ( Co@@ es@@ o ) agree , as well as patients themselves , such as F@@ ex z@@ ai@@ o , who came into the test of a particular laboratory , only motivated because a friend was made , and , despite their short age , was already in place of AIDS , and even suffered from K@@ a@@ ş@@ a , a carcinogenic tumor that is one of the common complications .
everything changes when you know that you have AIDS .
some think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything .
&quot; if I am going to be killed , the better I rise three times a week , &quot; they say not in my case .
the change was to improve , I am food , I exercise , I take drugs .
to date , their parents can only know that they suffered from cancer .
I live a normal life , like anyone .
&quot; work , I have many activities , I travel , I travel , I have an active , but responsible , sexual life , I went to myself and the other person , &quot; I listed F@@ open F@@ open , who agreed to share their Millennium privacy to motivate those who today , as part of the World AIDS Day , are afraid .
if they were in risk , if they were at risk , that they will soon know if they are positive HIV is better and if they already have diagnosis , to learn that they can live as any person , being responsible .
that , your message , sums up the motto of battle for AIDS this 2012 .
the M@@ ind After the M@@ ale
big are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen , argued Ricardo Sal@@ a , a journalist plug on the cause of HIV .
and the larger one is prevention .
in the places dedicated to this task , &apos; it has actually increased the distribution of condoms , before you gave us one or two , now you give us 100 , and that is all well and good , but there are those who still do not have access to a condom &apos; , he said .
among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
&quot; what do they want ? &quot; is a common question , with deaf ears and judgments in the value of social workers , school guides , pharmacies , and health personnel , to which adolescents are not to be exposed , secured the communicating .
it proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution ; that condoms should not only be left behind and those hundred are found in public bathing sites of the sites that young people are attending .
it is not a cause for motivation .
nor is it a question of paying them out , as the governor of the Mo@@ ri@@ i González said , to ask him whether he would be distributing condoms on his administration .
&quot; this is not the way that sexuality is , the best is to bring the condoms closer to those who already practise sexual activity , &quot; he pointed out .

there are 4@@ 35 accumulated cases ( 12.@@ 158 AIDS and 1.@@ 3@@ 17 HIV ) .
the state is national in cases in new and accumulated AIDS and 13 ° tonnes of HIV .
95 % of the infection is sex , 6 % for blood , and 2 % on the wrong track .
it is estimated that 50 000 people can be living with HIV because , for a case , there are 5 to 5 people who are not aware of it .
a ruling by a US appeal court a ruling that is unaware of the re@@ structure of the vitro group &apos;s debt achieved a successful trade contest in Mexico , the scenario puts a bad precedent for any national enterprise with ramifications in neighboring neighbor that has solvency problems .
it would be said , then , that the procedures for the restoration of the survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws to be allowed are not valid in the game of bars and stars , to counter international conventions .
in practical terms , the support for the sentence issued on Justice Har@@ lin Har@@ lin in the northern district of Brittany on 15 June last , leaves Mexican firms defenceless against the possibility of their properties in the past .
however , the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to come to the US Supreme Court , claiming three inconsistencies .
from the outset , while the judge &apos;s judge of the cause states that creditors should be governed by the United States &quot; Mis@@ as &quot; Act , the New Orleans &quot; court of appeals , says that the main procedure is the commercial competition dealt with in Mexico .
the first point would mean ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency by national @-@ profile companies .
in fact , to that end , the United Nations Mo@@ de@@ al Act was created for the uniformity of the International Food Standards Law , being used as a referee by the American En@@ w Institute .
secondly , the ruling states that without an inter @-@ company vote , recognised in the critical mass of the trade competition , the debts which the vitro subsidiaries had with their parent would not have been achieved by the majority required to approve the re@@ structure .
but the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws .
in fact , it was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted .
there are a number of half @-@ dozen examples of this , including Agricultural ex @-@ Commerce , whose inter @-@ company debts endorsed the Federal Institute for Business competitions .
the fact , moreover , is that by eroding subsidiaries &quot; votes , in any case , the vitro creditors who fought against this in the United States , namely the &quot; vulture &quot; funds such as the Capital of Capital , the International En@@ er@@ os , the International E@@ li@@ z , and Liverpool Li@@ u@@ ed , will not have achieved a majority .
the vote would have been 45 % against 37 .
the data is omitted from the Court of Appeal .
from another angle , this is the fault of the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 on the eve of the severe economic crisis that the United States faced , as a glue in the country .
as soon as possible , the signature of the González family , which will be signed up to the court of appeals , will call for the vote to be brought to the plenary sitting , namely the five judges , given that they voted only three .
it will not succeed that this will be called upon to resort to the Sardinia which requires the revision of the process by a higher body , in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States .
what is serious about the case is that the court ignored a document sent by Mexico &apos;s government under the &quot; friend of the Court &quot; ( &quot; friend of the Court &quot; ) , in which the procedure followed by the law on commercial competitions is detailed , pointing out that the court was bound by the conventions signed by both countries to fit this with Chapter 15 in the US bankruptcy law .
moreover , the country was pointed out to the principles of the UN Commission for International Trade , that is to say rules for cross @-@ border insolvency cases , which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors .

the &quot; H@@ x , &quot; H@@ tar , &quot; H@@ tar : &quot; the sin this has been my life . &quot;
the fine lines of the fire @-@ this H@@ tar &apos; H@@ th@@ in &apos; have been over 60 years old linked to the sport of the sp@@ ec@@ on@@ ge and , thanks to him , travelled the whole world .
few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of such a wide @-@ ranging local man@@ on@@ oc@@ a , such as the H@@ tar H@@ tar &quot; H@@ x . &quot;
and it is that before a brain spill confined him to a wheelchair in 2008 , he was plunged into sport for more than 60 years , to be as a player of minor categories , a player of the National Bal@@ on@@ ar , held , and leader in the B@@ S@@ N with Bay@@ am@@ ón jeans or Chairman of the Federation of Bal@@ on@@ c@@ ar .
&quot; I put a lot of hats in the bal@@ on@@ ch this through my life , including several of them at the same time , as when I was chairman of the B@@ S@@ N , the CEO of the National National Teams and federalist president during the 1990 &quot; s , &quot; he recalled in a visit of First H@@ ora to his home in Bay@@ am@@ on , where he is with Elizabeth , his faithful wife , his faithful wife for more than 50 years .
&quot; he has been my life . &quot;
they are not exaggerating by making that claim .
the walls of his house , almost all of them packed with photos and anniversaries that show his wide track record , are evidence of this .
Stanford at the heart
of all , the most emotional @-@ sounding , the people who remind them of their passage through the jeans since the mid @-@ decade of the 50 as a player until 1982 , when it served 15 years by melting out or taking on the bar .
&quot; those were my best years , those who enjoyed me the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight tournament championships since 1967 , whether it be seized , co@@ prey or leader .
they were many years of satisfaction , including the five championships from 1971 to 1975 .
and then I had a plea for one in 1981 , the year of the no @-@ fly in the Ben@@ om@@ e Min@@ a and the B@@ S@@ N .
that was the case at the time , when he wrote a great manager , &quot; Or@@ t@@ z , who was a great administrator . &quot;
I recall that G@@ ene Bar@@ to@@ w , who had been headed here and was at the University of A@@ t@@ t@@ ama ( Birmingham ) , he said to me : &apos; I have a strong player , of 6 &apos; 7 &apos; in stature .
do you want it ? &apos;
and that was the principle of Min@@ a , one of the best players that Puerto Rico has had .
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the Franco @-@ winner Felipe G@@ in@@ se , who was a na@@ vi@@ ised , and was one of our best ch@@ ors .
I recall that he said that if Mel@@ ha@@ y had given a championship to Mur@@ am@@ on , G@@ in@@ ain would help to bring another .
the champagne with G@@ in@@ ors was enjoyed , but already on the distance , because for 1988 it was already a feder@@ ator .
for that reason , he preferred to enjoy his performance , and that of Mo@@ in@@ y in the National Task Force .
I remember when we won for the first time from the United States during the Mexico Olympics in 1989 .
then came the World Cup in 1990 , where there was fourth place , and it should have been to@@ 11 if it were not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final move for the second time , said K@@ a .
is the World Bank &apos;s 1990 group the best national teams that have seen ?
it is among the best , as is the one that was won by T@@ am T@@ M in the 2004 Olympics .
but my favorite was that of the Pan @-@ Americans in Cuba in 1991 , when we gain gold and put one hand on the US team , which was quite similar to the one that won the clock in the world .
that team not only repeated M@@ im@@ y , G@@ in@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ va , Fi@@ co i López , and &quot; Pi@@ o@@ z , &quot; but also had to ( Javier ) &quot; Toyota , and James Carter &apos;s young Carter ( Francis and Ed@@ ar ) , and Mario Francis , and Mario &quot; Bibi , &quot; Morales , who had not been able to be in 90 , owing to an injury to the penalty .
a team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff , but it gave us a gold coin , and a great deal of joy was that of the 1995 P@@ uc@@ u@@ ar P@@ au@@ le , Argentina .
with role players such as the C@@ an@@ o &quot; C@@ an@@ to , Paul Aliyev , and a young man in the middle of Th@@ ar H@@ ay@@ i@@ as@@ ot@@ er on the replacement of the frozen players for the maze of the R@@ American Sea of the Pan@@ ata , we earn gold against all forecasts .
what has Puerto Rico &apos;s best player ?
it is certainly the case , that has been Pi@@ o@@ ín Or@@ t@@ z .
their numbers at the level of international lotteries are impressive .
no one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level , as Pi@@ n@@ ín did .
and that does not count on your career in the different leagues you played .
who has been the best ubiquitous leader ?
that is very difficult .
we have had a very good bargain , including in July T@@ gold , the M@@ u Mo@@ n@@ n@@ in , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dal@@ m@@ au , Ar@@ man@@ sh@@ Torres .
for young people , I very much like the work of Le@@ o A@@ ll .
what do you think of your greatest achievement in the federation ?
we had been part of the most glorious of the National Code from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990 &quot; s , the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
what did you have to do ?
there were things that you would have wanted to implement , such as regionalisation of the minor categories .
for example , the N@@ 11 boys would only play in their area and only face equipment from other corners of the island in national players .
now children are travelling and playing too badly .
at the very least I see the fruit of microchips and course for leaders , table officers and arbiter .
I am pleased about that .
what do you do now ?
all I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my time on YouTube , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to fire games .
and , of course , to enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .
the Bo@@ el actor Larry H@@ Man
Raj@@ el H@@ man , born on September 21 , 1931 , at In@@ z@@ h F@@ h ( Texas ) , became world @-@ famous for his central role , such as John Rosales , who is more known as &quot; J@@ R , &quot; in the television series &quot; , in which he embodied a malicious , malicious , and manipulated man .
the role such as the oil @-@ loving oil tycoon J.@@ R@@ - Ewing in the television series , &quot; D@@ ed@@ us &quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s , has died .
it was 81 years .
Mr President , who returned in the form of a new &quot; art &quot; season , he died on Friday afternoon because of cancer complications , in accordance with a family communiqué provided to The Associated Press by the T@@ ner T@@ ner B@@ os , who is a &quot; master &quot; house .
&quot; Larry was back in his dear home city of D@@ es@@ ar , once again representing the &quot; likes it &quot; paper , he said the family .
the family of Larry , and their closest friends , were with him in D@@ ar for the website of gratitude .
the part of the report , which interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and in the aftermath , was with Hag@@ man when he died in a rogue hospital , he said the advertising of her , Jeffrey Lan@@ e .
he was happy to know him .
it was to be creative , generous , fun , amusing , comfortable , and talented , and I will be very surprised at that .
&quot; he was a original person and lived the life to the maximum , &quot; he said , he said , and in a communiqué .
H@@ man diagnosed him with the liver of the liver in 1992 and acknowledged that he had eaten a great deal for years .
in 1995 , a malignant tumor was found in the liver and subjected to a transplant .

she interpreted the captain Tony Nelson , an astronomical man whose life is disrupted when he finds an attractive genius , interpreted by Barbara E@@ den , and he leads him to live with him home .
it was also a two @-@ stroke player , who had little time for the air , &quot; The Go@@ od Life , &quot; ( N@@ BC , 1971 @-@ 72 ) , and &quot; h@@ a W@@ e G@@ o A@@ g@@ in &quot; ( A@@ BC , 1973 ) .
his work in the cinema included roles that are welcomed by the criticism in The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the &quot; The Group of the European People &apos;s Party &quot; and &quot; First Col@@ ors . &quot;
but he was his judge on the wisdom of the beloved Archbishop J.@@ R@@ . that he brought the He@@ man to his knees .
the dramatic series of the C@@ BS chain over the Ewing clan and others in its orbit was in the air of April 1978 to May 1991 .
the German phrase &quot; W@@ o sh@@ ot J.@@ R@@ . &quot; designed to generate expectations around a full @-@ profile episode in which the D@@ ah@@ man &apos;s character almost is murdered , generated an international speculation and millions of risky dollars in betting houses .
it also helped to give the series a record record at that time .
when the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter , an average of 41 million TV viewers framed it and turned &quot; D@@ ed@@ es &quot; into the history of the second largest entertainment program behind the end of &quot; Mas@@ h &quot; in 1983 , which had 50 million spectators .
that was the du@@ d of J.@@ R@@ . , K@@ vo@@ n ( interpreted by Mary C@@ ren@@ by ) that he shot .
to put it mildly , he was then threatened to accuse him of prostitution unless he was outside the city , but others also had reason to attack him .
D@@ man interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile : a rogue businessman and an un@@ faithful husband who tried his alcoholic wife , Su@@ and E@@ len ( Lin@@ da Pal@@ y ) , to be an opponent .
&quot; I know what I would like to see what I would like to see in the V@@ R , &apos; S@@ man , &apos; he said in 1988 .
it should be said : &apos; here lies the honest citizen , J.@@ Ewing &apos; .
this is the only negotiation that he lost .

it proved lucky in New York &apos;s performance scenarios at the beginning of the 1950 &quot; s , and then served the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England .
while he was there , he met the young Swedish design of Swedish designer A@@ x@@ at@@ le and married him .
the couple had two children , Pro@@ on@@ on , and Ash@@ i , and lived for a long time in the California city of Mali , where there are many platitudes .

&quot; I did not put anything in the way that I believed I believed to hurt someone or hit them in some way , &quot; he said associated with the press at the time .
after the liver transplant , he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to attend fearful patients .
&quot; I advise you , I give you courage , I meet them when they come for their sports , and then , &quot; he indicated in 1996 .
if you want to offer some comfort , such as &quot; don &apos;t fear , it will be a bit uncomfortable for a short time , but they are going to be good . &quot;
he was also a smoking activist and took part in several campaigns .

every week , students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war , zombie , viruses , and seeds , and global warming .
this six @-@ month period , when a friend in religion Stuart Ch@@ ar@@ é decided to carry a course on the end of the world , he knew that he had an irresistible pen : an end to the &quot; regressive &quot; of Cal@@ end@@ ant M@@ aya , on 21 December , to which many people have stood up as a test of the world &apos;s end .
but Ch@@ ar@@ é had no idea what he had hoped for in the next couple of months : the mutation of Hurricane Sandy , a fiscal cliff that some have called &quot; debtor &apos;s debtor , &quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel , the place where Christian theorists of the end of the times believe that the CPA will begin .
&quot; I did not realise that this was going to be the most apocalyptic six @-@ month period , &quot; he said , this week , the students at Ru@@ t@@ ers @-@ Cam@@ den ( New Jersey ) .
if you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and count , this has been a really good period .
and remember that evil is good for the apocalyptic mentality .
and he is not only a professor who offers courses on the &quot; end of the world &quot; this six @-@ month period , theoretically the last story .
at the time , the deputy professor , Mr News , and the President of the European Parliament , are setting the course for the media , the culture and the end of the world .
every week , students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war , zombie , viruses , and seeds , and global warming .
&quot; we look at why these ideas spread over time , &quot; he said , and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide some human behavior .
if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could erupt .
this month , students studied films with apocalyptic issues and explored how they compare with examples of real life .
&quot; I have tried to inform students about what is possible , likely , credible and impossible , &quot; he said , he said .
in the main craft of the State University of Pennsylvania , Latin America &apos;s history professor Cam@@ w R@@ rou@@ l and his colleague A@@ à Sol@@ ari , a deputy professor of History of the Ar@@ te and anthropo@@ logy , have made a team to carry out a course , entitled only &quot; The End of the world . &quot;
&quot; we do not add &quot; 2012 &quot; to always count on the option of managing the course again , if the world does not end , &quot; he said , he said .
despite &quot; imminent ruin , &quot; students must study , generate projects , and take final examinations .
in Pennsylvania , the final review will be taken on the eve of the Gräßle , which leaves students no more than working to &quot; work &quot; to the very night that the world is supposed to end , &quot; said R@@ rou@@ l .
the courses were rather popular .
&quot; it was saturated in two hours , &quot; he said , he said that he was filled for high @-@ average students , who filled himself with 35 students .
we received messages from e @-@ mail for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the six months , of people asking whether there was still room .
students , for their part , claim that the course is one of the most interesting .
&quot; I am fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves , &quot; said Brid@@ g@@ d Robinson , a student of the 23 years &apos; career in religious and soci@@ ology of HADEP , New Jersey , in Ru@@ t@@ ers @-@ Cam@@ den .
and it is that the apocalyptic , secular , or religious mindset is only a matter of comfort or absence .
that is the one , a student from the race for geo@@ logy and br@@ u@@ be@@ r@@ in , 25 years old , he said that he had seen all the apocalyptic films .
&quot; he had never heard about a class that could teach him , &quot; he indicated .
I enjoy it .
but no student interviewed - and much less a professor - said that he believed in the expiry date of 21 December .
&quot; our first project dealt with a self @-@ perpetuating prophecy , &quot; he said Ju@@ lie Z@@ eg@@ en , a last year student , a 21 @-@ year @-@ old and West Ch@@ ester .
generals never predicted the end of the world ; it is just a key point in the calendar , he said R@@ rou@@ l .
but he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to the changes around them in the eyes of the world &apos;s end .
the Internet has caused a boom in these speculation .
&quot; in other quarters people do not think of this , &quot; he said .
they are mostly in the English @-@ speaking world .
Liu Del@@ u@@ ty , a religion professor at La Sal@@ le University , which provides courses in the Philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about some course over the &quot; end of the world &quot; there .
&quot; the Philippines is not participating in the end of the world , &quot; he wrote , suggesting an exception for a higher authority .
we have a pardon from the Pope .
he pointed out that over the years we have been talking about many days of the final trial , and he said that if nothing happens on 21 December , &quot; people will start to think immediately in the next date &quot; or to spy that 21 December is the beginning of a seven @-@ year period after the world will end .
students and teachers are being taken lightly to the date .
they have said that they intend to go to holidays , &quot; at the end of the world . &quot;
